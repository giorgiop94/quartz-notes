[[Book - Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu]]

## Stephen Mitchell Translation
If you overesteem great men,
people become powerless.
If you overvalue possessions,
people begin to steal<sup>1</sup>.

The Master leads
by emptying peopleâ€™s minds and
filling their cores, by weakening their ambition<sup>2</sup>
and toughening their resolve.
He helps people lose everything
they know, everything they desire<sup>3</sup>,
and creates confusion
in those who think that they know<sup>4</sup>.

Practice not-doing<sup>5</sup>,
and everything will fall into place.

## Other translations I like

### - [[Stephen Addiss & Stanley Lombardo]]

Don't glorify heroes, And people will not contend.
Don't treasure rare objects, And no one will steal.
Don't display what people desire, And their hearts will not be disturbed.
Therefore, the Sage rules By emptying hearts and filling bellies, By weakening ambitions and strengthening bones; Leads people Away from knowing and wanting;
Deters those who know too much From going too far:
Practices non-action And the natural order is not disrupted.

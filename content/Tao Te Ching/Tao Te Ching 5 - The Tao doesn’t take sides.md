title: Tao Te Ching 5 - The Tao doesn’t take sides

[[Book - Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu]]

## Stephen Mitchell Translation
The Tao doesn’t take sides;
it gives birth to both good and evil.
The Master doesn’t take sides;
she welcomes both saints and sinners.

The Tao is like a bellows:
it is empty yet infinitely capable.
The more you use it, the more it produces;
the more you talk of it, the less you understand.

Hold on to the center. 

-----------------
## Other translations I like
Heaven and Earth are not kind: 
The ten thousand things are straw dogs to them.
The Sage is not kind: 
People are straw dogs to him.
Yet Heaven and Earth And all the space between Are like a bellows: 
Empty but inexhaustible, Always producing more.
Longwinded speech is exhausting. Better to stay centered.

Stephen Addiss & Stanley Lombardo

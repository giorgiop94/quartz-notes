[[Book - Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu]]

## Stephen Mitchell Translation

The tao that can be told
is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named
is not the eternal Name<sup>1</sup>.

The unnamable is the eternally real<sup>2</sup>.
Naming is the origin of all particular things.

Free from desire, you realize the mystery.
Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.

Yet mystery and manifestations
arise from the same source.
This source is called darkness.

Darkness within darkness.
The gateway to all understanding

## Other translations I like

### -  [[Ursula Le Guin]]

The way you can go
isn’t the real way.
The name you can say
isn’t the real name.

Heaven and earth
begin in the unnamed:
name’s the mother
of the ten thousand things.

So the unwanting soul
sees what’s hidden,
and the ever-wanting soul
sees only what it wants.

Two things, one origin,
but different in name,
whose identity is mystery.

Mystery of all mysteries!
The door to the hidden.

title: Tao Te Ching 12 - Thoughts Desires and Trusting
---
[[Book - Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu]]

## Stephen Mitchell Translation
Colors blind the eye.
Sounds deafen the ear.
Flavors numb the taste.
Thoughts weaken the mind.
Desires wither the heart.

The Master observes the world
but trusts his inner vision.
He allows things to come and go.
His heart is open as the sky.

-------------------
## Other translations I like
Five colors blind the eyes.
Five tones deafen the ears.
Five flavors dull the palate.
Riding and hunting drive us crazy,
the desire for things leads to wrongs.

That’s why the sage
nourishes the belly, not merely the eye,
choosing one, not the other. [[Sam Hamill]]

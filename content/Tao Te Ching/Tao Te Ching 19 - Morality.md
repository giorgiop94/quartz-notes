title: Tao Te Ching 19 - Morality
---
[[Book - Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu]]

## Stephen Mitchell Translation
Throw away holiness and wisdom,
and people will be a hundred times happier.

Throw away morality and justice,
and people will do the right thing<sup>1</sup>.

Throw away industry and profit,
and there won’t be any thieves<sup>2</sup>.

If these three aren’t enough,
just stay at the center of the circle
and let all things take their course<sup>3</sup>.

-------------------

1: [[Morality is a poor surrogate of humanity]]
2: [[avoid greed and compulsive consumption]]
3: [[go with the flow]] / [[Wu Wei]]
4: [[Yin Yang]]

## Other translations 
### -  [[Ursula Le Guin]]
In the degradation of the great way
come benevolence and righteousness.
With the exaltation of learning and prudence
comes immense hypocrisy.
The disordered family
is full of dutiful children and parents.
The disordered society
is full of loyal patriots

### - [[Stephen Addiss & Stanley Lombardo]]
Great Tao rejected: Benevolence and righteousness appear.
Learning and knowledge professed: Great Hypocrites spring up.
Family relations forgotten: Filial piety and affection arise.
The nation disordered: Patriots come forth.

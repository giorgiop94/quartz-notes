[[Book - Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu]]

## Stephen Mitchell Translation
We join spokes together in a wheel,
but it is the center hole
that makes the wagon move.

We shape clay into a pot,
but it is the emptiness inside
that holds whatever we want.

We hammer wood for a house,
but it is the inner space
that makes it livable.

**We work with being,
but non-being is what we use.**

-------------------
## Other translations I like
Thirty spokes meet in the hub.
Where the wheel isn’t is where it’s useful.

Hollowed out, clay makes a pot.
Where the pot’s not is where it’s useful.

Cut doors and windows to make a room.
Where the room isn’t, there’s room for you.

So the profit in what is, is in the use of what isn’t. [[Ursula Le Guin]]

-------------------

Thirty spokes join one hub.
The wheel's use comes from emptiness.

Clay is fired to make a pot.
The pot's use comes from emptiness.

Windows and doors are cut to make a room.
The room's use comes from emptiness.

Therefore, Having leads to profit, Not having leads to use. [[Stephen Addiss & Stanley Lombardo]]

-------------------

Thirty spokes join in one hub
In its emptiness, there is the function of a vehicle

Mix clay to create a container
In its emptiness, there is the function of a container2

Cut open doors and windows to create a room
In its emptiness, there is the function of a room

Therefore, that which exists is used to create benefit
That which is empty is used to create functionality [[Derek Lin]]

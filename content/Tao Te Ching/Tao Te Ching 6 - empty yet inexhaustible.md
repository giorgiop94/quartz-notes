[[Book - Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu]]

## Stephen Mitchell Translation
The Tao is called the Great Mother: 
empty yet inexhaustible,
it gives birth to infinite worlds.

It is always present within you.
You can use it any way you want. - Stephen Mitchell

----------
## Other translations I like
The valley spirit, undying 
Is called the Mystic Female1 

The gateway of the Mystic Female 
is called the root of Heaven and Earth2 

It flows continuously, barely perceptible 
When utilized, it is never exhausted - [[Derek Lin]]

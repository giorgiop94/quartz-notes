title: Tao Te Ching 20 - Stop Thinking and End Your Problems
---
[[Book - Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu]]

## Stephen Mitchell Translation
Stop thinking, and end your problems.<sup>1</sup>
What difference between yes and no?<sup>2</sup>
What difference between success and failure?
Must you value what others value,<sup>3</sup>
avoid what others avoid?
How ridiculous!

Other people are excited,
as though they were at a parade.
I alone don’t care,
I alone am expressionless,
like an infant before it can smile.

Other people have what they need;
I alone possess nothing.<sup>4</sup>
I alone drift about,
like someone without a home.
I am like an idiot, my mind is so empty.

Other people are bright;
I alone am dark.

Other people are sharp;
I alone am dull.

Other people have a purpose;
I alone don’t know.<sup>5</sup>

I drift like a wave on the ocean,
I blow as aimless as the wind.<sup>6</sup>
I am different from ordinary people.
I drink from the Great Mother’s breasts.

## Other translations 

### - [[Stephen Addiss & Stanley Lombardo]]
Banish learning, no more grief. Between Yes and No How much difference? Between good and evil How much difference??
What others fear I must fear - How pointless!
People are wreathed in smiles As if at a carnival banquet. I alone am passive, giving no sign, Like an infant who has not yet smiles. Forlorn as if I had no home.
Others have enough and more, I alone am left out. I have the mind of a fool, Confused, confused.
Others are bright and intelligent, I alone and dull, dull, Drifting on the ocean, Blown about endlessly.
Others have plans, I alone am wayward and stubborn, I alone am different from others, Like a baby in the womb.

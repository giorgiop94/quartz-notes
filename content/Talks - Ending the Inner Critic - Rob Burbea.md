## What's the Inner Critic?
- A sub-personality
	- A manifestation of one's Self view
	- A filter that colors our everyday life
- Continuously judging and blaming us
	- Has a sense of harshness
- It may have its origin in childhood
	- But we are construing it in our mind everyday
- Its power is in its vagueness
	- **The more we focus our attention on it, the more it loses power**

### Effects on Us
- Creates a sense of inadequacy, not being enough, [[fear]]
- It suppresses deep seated needs of human beings:
	- Capacity for self-expression and [[Creativity]]
	- Capacity for intimacy and revealing oneself
- Sometimes it affects even our relationships
	- We project it onto others and feel judged

- The inner critic is prevalent in our society
	- Individualism and consumerism all contribute to its formation
	- Even if we are not very materialistic, the air we breathe favors the inner critic

### How it Affects Practice
- "Should" comes into practice
	- Creates pressure
	- Removes intrinsic motivation
	- Takes the joy out of practice, it doesn't feel like a gift
- In reaction to the Inner Critic, we create the Inner Rebel
	- Pressures us to not practice anymore
	- Inner Rebel is a manifestation of a healthy life force
- IC stifles questioning in practice and ability to play
	- It criticizes us when we get distracted, instead of allowing us to inquire
	- We need to accept distraction to inquire, but IC won't let us
	- The only question IC allows us to ask is "Am I doing it right?"
		- Can we instead ask "How am I?"
		- Introduce kindness in practice

## Ending the Inner Critic

### Metta
- **The IC is just a mental habit of negative thinking**
- Practicing [[Metta]] we create new habits of thinking
	- Sow the seeds of kindness towards ourselves and all beings
- When IC is very strong, the Metta phrases may seem ridiculous, fake
	- Over time this has tremendous effects
- May be tempted to keep the Metta towards ourselves only
	- Directing Metta to all beings, we can't help but be soaked into it
	- **We do need love from others as well**
		- Dharma culture focuses on everything coming from inside us
			- True on some levels, but love from others can also be extremely healing

### Mindfulness (Kindness)
- Can we let the IC be there?
	- Give it kindness and give it space
- Instinctive reaction may be [[The 5 Hindrances#Aversion]], wanting to get rid of it
	- The IC is a force of aversion, getting rid of aversion with aversion is like pouring gasoline on fire
- Each criticism ends up creating some pain in the body
	- Can we be with it with kindness, warmth, care?

### Mindfulness (Deconstruction)
- The IC is a mix of feelings, thoughts, textures
- We re-create and strengthen the IC in our minds everyday
	- Can we deconstruct them to each individual sensation and stay with each separately?
		- e.g. listen to the tone of the voice, feel the sensations in the heart
	- If we don't "join the dots" we don't give the IC the capacity to create vicious cycles


### Questioning and Talking to the Inner Critic
- Am I believing the Inner Critic?
	- Do I believe I am a bad person and I need to feel shame?
	- Do I believe I am a phony, and it's only a matter of time before others find out?
- Can I allow [[The 5 Heroic Motivations#Great Doubt]] to come in?
- Is this IC pattern giving me anything?
	- A feeling of familiarity perhaps?
	- Is it trying to protect me from something?
- Can we try conversating with the IC?
	- Understand its fears, its instinctive behaviors, and perhaps we can re-assure him

### Re-claiming our Power
- Is meditation disconnecting us from our power?
- The Inner Rebel, rebelling against the IC, is one manifestation of our power
	- Power to say no, that's enough
- How can we connect with our inner power?
	- Metta can feel powerful
	- Connecting with the feelings of energy in the body
	- Connecting with the Inner Rebel, and its images
	- Using the intellect, to question and outsmart the IC

## Other Ways to Gradually Weaken the IC 
### Focusing on our Qualities
- Not an ego trick
- Culture pressures us to assess our success by worldy achievements
	- What would it be like to measure ourselves by how ethically we live? 
	- Kindness, generosity etc.... Qualities that our heart longs for

### Living Rooted in our Deepest Desire
- If we are living in accordance to what we truly desire, there will be less room for the comparing and judging mind to step in and bother us

### Realizing Dependent Co-Arising
- We are quick to blame and criticize our Self when we make a mistake or act unskillfully
- We can learn to realize that all our actions are based on causes and conditions
	- Maybe you were stressed, tired etc...
- WHere is the Self?

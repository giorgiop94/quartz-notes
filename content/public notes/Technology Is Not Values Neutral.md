title: Technology Is Not Values Neutral 
---
## Different (naive) views on [[technology]]
Technology as **neutral** view: Common idea that technology simply increases capacity, but it does not affect values: you can use a hammer to build a house or hurt people.

Techno-Utopian View: Tech is **values positive**. Tech gets selected only if it gets selected by the market, thus creating value for people.

Luddite View: Tech messes up religion, our values, ecosystems and is actually **net-negative** on society

## Complex view: 
**Tech is values affective, it affects values in complex ways, both positive and negative.** In designing new tech we need to take into account both the positive and negative externalities, in addition to the main purpose it was created for.

- tech affects psychology and then affects culture

- The technology you have at hand changes your perception of the world ([[ways of looking]]), and your intention and extends your actuation capacity
	- a camera may orient you to look for beauty
	- a chainsaw to cutting trees
	- a spear to kill things or hit targets

- We normally design tech for a specific, narrow purpose
	- when designing new tech we need to think about externalities
		- not only physical ones, also psycho-social externalities
		- Instagram, with its focus on images, introduction of filters and emphasis on likes bred narcissism and body dysmorphia across population

### Example of the Plow
- The plow revolutionized agriculture, increasing food production by relying on animal work (ox)
	- Caloric output using the plow increased dramatically
		- **Technology becomes obligate** - If a tech confers a lot of capacity, it also confer a game-theoretic advantage in a rivalrous context. Any group without that tech gets outcompeted (arms races)
	- Changed value systems around animals
		- having to beat animals forced humans to remove the sacredness from animals (societies used to be animistic before)
	- More surplus - more capacity for wealth inequality
	- Women could not operate plows - contributed to spread of patriarchal society

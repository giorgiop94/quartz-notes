## Some Key Ideas
### Avoiding/Addressing Existential and Catastrophic Risks
- [[The Metacrisis]] -> [[Podcast - Green Pill with Daniel Schmachtenberger]]
	- Useful to look at all our current biggest issues in a holistic way
		- trying to solve one problem might make the other ones worse
		- we can find the common "generator functions" (root causes) of our crises and try to solve for those
			- [[coordination failures - multipolar traps (Moloch)]]
				- arms races for AI, biotech, exponential tech
				- [[Tragedy of the Commons]]
				- perverse business incentives to skip careful risk assessments 
					- "privatize gains socialize losses"
	- two high-risk attractors
		- Increasing Catastrophes & Breakdown
		- Dystopic Control Structures
	- Third Attractor as something that allows us to avoid other attractors
	- what's worth optimizing for is not definable
		- 
- [[Technology Is Not Values Neutral]]
- Collective [[sense-making]] and [[choice-making]]
	- [[epistemic humility]]
	- [[Information Commons]]
		- [[Protector memes help memes last longer]]
		- [[Propagative memes propagate more than true memes]]
- [[both-and thinking]]
	- Think about the people your message doesn't appeal to, how can you include them and their blowback?
	- creating a higher order synthesis of different perspectives
- [[addiction is a signal of a less healthy and sovereign society]]
	- [[thinking about success metrics]]
	- [[Compersion]] may be the feature of individuals in a healthy society	
- [[what we call human nature is mostly human conditioning]]
	- our genetics selected for memetics

### Living
- Self as a separate thing is a misnomer
> "What am I without the Sun? Without the electromagnetic field? Without the Higgs boson? Without plants, algae, biosphere, or ozone layer? I don't exist. Me as a separate thing is actually a misnomer. It doesn't even exist."
- living a [[Meaningful Life]]
	- being
	- doing
	- becoming
- [[Sovereignty]]
- [[dealing with the hopelessness of our complex situation]]
- [[emotions remind us of whats important to us]]
- [[post tragic]] personal dialectic [[both-and thinking]]
	- if you're not outraged you're not paying attention
	- if you're not overwhelmed by the beauty of life you're not paying attention
		- the outrage comes from the care for the beauty and wanting to preserve it
		- if I'm always outraged I'm not connected to the beauty and unable to honor it
		- how can we be with the beauty of life while working to try to preserve this beauty for future generations?

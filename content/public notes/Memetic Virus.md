title: Memetic Virus 
---
Ideas can infect people just like viruses and create some sort of psychological pandemic. As more people get infected it becomes easier and easier for the virus to spread as [[human minds are awfully malleable]]

Large scale examples are:
- Slavery (and the fact that everyone was ok with it)
- Capitalism
- Consumerism
- Nazism
- Black Friday

On a smaller scale, whenever someone is feeling a certain way they spread it to other people. [[emotions are contagious]]

Mainstream media has a huge power to spread these kinds of viruses, but today with [[social media]] it is much easier for anyone to spread memetic viruses.

Now they are much easier to spread. 

- [[Propagative memes propagate more than true memes]]
- [[Protector memes help memes last longer]]

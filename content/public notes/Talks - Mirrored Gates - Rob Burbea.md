Talks by [[Rob Burbea]] supplementing, elaborating, clarifying previous materials on Soulmaking Dharma

## Talk 1 
### What's Meant by Imaginal Here?
- Imaginal is way more than images that come up in the mind's eye (Intra-psychic images)
- Difference between imagination of Papancha and a mindful use of imagination (in metta practice)
	- The latter is deliberate, it keeps awareness of the energy body, there's an intention behind it
- There can also be "healing imagination" - Imagining healing figures
- All those aren't necessarily imaginal
- We can think of a **spectrum** going from papancha to fully imaginal
- Difference between how Rob uses the word Imaginal and how Hillman or other psychologists used it

### What Makes Images "Imaginal"?
Aware of the dangers of lists becoming too strict and prescriptive, Rob made a list of elements that make images Imaginal. The list is more meant as keys to deepen one's practice, but it shouldn't be regarded too strictly.

*Looseness with precision*

We don't reject concepts and delineations, we start with where we are and allow elements and qualities to expand and develop

- "Imaginal" is **more about the Way of Looking than the Object**
	- Included awareness of the energy body
	- less fabrication

- Love and being loved
- Eros
- Beauty
- Sense of dimensionality (depth) opening to a sense of divinity
- A sense of beyondness (there's more to the image than one can grasp)
- Autonomy (images have their distinct independent being)
	- Two-ness (me and the image)
- Infinite Echoing between the image and my life
	- Images pregnant with meaningfulness
- Images not reduced, limited to one meaning
- Neither real nor not real (Imaginal Middle Way)
- Not-nonconceptual (it involves conceptuality and logos)
- Timelessness
- Humility
	- We feel humble in relationship to the image
- Reverence
- Grace
- Duty
- Trust
- Primary intention is not for self
- Brings a sense of Soulmaking
	- Eros-psyche-logos dynamic is stimulated, expands and fertilized
	- More than heartfulness
- Images are part of a bigger context of possible other images (concertina?)

### Sensing with Soul
- Almost interchangeable with "Imaginal"
- Seeing the "real world" around us imaginally

Imaginal and Soulmaking are dynamic experiences, getting more complicated, deeper, expanding, affecting the sense of self

## Talk 2

### Letting Images Arise
- Play, patience and experimentation are key
- Sometimes we try too hard
	- Once we notice that we may want to dwell in some Samadhi or Emptiness practice
- We don't want to only practice imaginal
	- We want to alternate, move in and out of practices, put down images
	- We can even let the mind drift for a while
- Sometimes we need to stop meditating
	- Imaginal images may already be in our lives, in how we see our lives or the people close to us
	- We don't need meditation to see them, just some understanding and awareness to  notice them

### Possible Techniques
- Deepening into [[Samadhi]] or [[Emptiness]] practice and then relaxing the attention
	- Can be fertile grounds for images
- Recalling a dream figure or image and meditating on it
- Deliberate meditation on certain figures
	- Tantric deities, characters from history or literature that touched you, or people you know
	- Your body as a body of light
	- Playing with different images
- Image of descending a staircase towards a cell, and finding out what's there


**Remarkability of images is not that important**
- Images that don't seem remarkable can still be considered "imaginal" and have **soul resonance**
	- We shouldn't dismiss images that come up too quickly

## Talk 3 - 3 Elements 

Nothing makes an image inherently "imaginal".

If it is imaginal it will depend on how that image relates to the person who's having it

### Energy Body
- [[Energy Body Practice]]

*Energy body is a way of looking or conceiving the body as a space of vibration, energy, texture*

- Body is not limited to the scientific materialist view

- Not a specific experience but a range of experiences

### Soulmaking 
- [[SoulMaking Dharma]]
- **Eros, psyche and logos** are involved
- One way to intend Psyche is Image
	- May not be image in the obvious sense
	- It may be the fantasy of what is happening, and the Self in relation to it
- A sense of **newness**, expansion of boundaries, of opening the heart
	- An image doesn't necessarily need to be involved
	- Newness may bring a sense of eros
- **Playfulness** and **heartfulness** also key components

### Loving and Being Loved
- The imaginal being loves you in a particular way, specific to that image
- Love is two ways â†’ We also love the figure
- Our definitions of love are often very narrow
	- Love can be rigid, stern, disciplined but also soft, warm, comforting etc...

## Talk 4
### Middle Path of the Imaginal
- Open to **receiving**, while also deliberately bringing up the elements
- We receive grace, gifts (receptivity, flexibility, attunement)
- Not just about technique, but technique is a component of it
- Not completely in our control
	- **Soul is greater than me, than ego**

### Sparking Imaginal
- Elements in the list can serve as sparks
	- Once one is present, it creates a quantum leap bringing us to the imaginal
		- Not necessarily like switches (on/off), more like spectrum
- We can gradually "turn on" elements by paying careful attention to them
	- We can play around with the relative emphasis of our attention
	- It can be mostly focused on the energy body, or on the image, or on emotions, while keeping a subtle awareness of the other elements

### Eros
- We need to be familiar with how eros feels
- Eros supports an opening
	- Craving is constricting, limiting

### Beauty
- There's a huge range of beauty that we can feel touched by and open to
	- Like love, our view of beauty tends to be limited
- This practice encourages us to look for different kinds, flavors of beauty

### Dimensionality/Divinity
- Perceptions/images are not flat
- They have a depth that leads to a sense of divinity
	- Infinite possibilities for the experience of divinity
- We tend to have "resistance" to the word Divinity, because of its associations and histories
- In this practice, we don't consider divinity as "more real"
	- Divinity is consider as deeper in the sense that it takes more practice and sensitivity to sense them
	- Not ontological distinction, but epistemological
	- **Divinity is neither real nor unreal** ([[Emptiness]])
- Similarly, we don't see the material as unholy or illusion

### Grace
- Quality of being given, receiving something
	- A sense of gift, surprise
- Not arising because of luck, or because of my clever engineering

### Reverence
- To be in "awe of" something greater, beyond us
	- Involves the heart and soul
	- We can feel it in the energy body, a sense of pliability, softening, opening, energizing
- Reverence sometimes associated with a sense of "should"
	- Not the case here, a reverence associated with Eros

### Humility
- [[Modernism]] made us arrogant in some ways
	- Mastery over nature, we can fix and control everything etc...
- Does not imply self-shaming, blaming or punishing, or anything that is life denying
	- Even if we don't explicitly mean them, humility sometimes gets confused and mixed with those
- Doesn't preclude empowerment
	- **Empowerment and humility can co-exist**. Only if we don't identify with either
- Act of *bowing* (not necessarily physical)
- Humility goes with **reverence and respect for the other, and for the self**
- Humility involves participation of the Self, not an alienation
	- **I am included in what I am humble towards**
- Humility (like grace and other elements) itself can become image, an object of eros
	- It can expand, break, shift, transform

### Trust
- Sometimes disturbing images may arise that may feel wrong, inappropriate, pathological (sexually related or not)
	- Can we put a grain of trust that there's a **greater, soul intelligence that our mind doesn't understand**?
	- Sometimes, simply trusting the image will cause it to transform, sometimes it won't
	- Can we stay with it?
- If the energy body feels better, even if our mind is disturbed by the image, we can use that as an indicator that we're on the right track

### Duty
- Not necessarily only in regards to images
- If we get a new idea, or a new way of looking that we hadn't seen before, we might feel a **sense of duty to pursue it further**

## Other
Imaginal practices make us question what is our [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]]

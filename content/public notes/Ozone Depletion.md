title: Ozone Depletion 
---
The Ozone layer protects the Earth from harmful ultra-violet rays emitted from the Sun.

Ultra-violet rays cause:
- Skin cancer
- Cataracts
- Damage to vegetation

### Depletion
One of the [[Planetary Boundaries]].

- Chemicals (chlorofluorocarbons) that we used as refrigerants, as solvents, propellants move up the atmosphere (chlorine, bromine) and breaking ozone molecules apart, thereby depleting the stratospheric layer.

- Montreal protocol in the mid-1980s instrumental to stop depletion and move towards a safe operating space
- But we still have to be careful
	- Methane also affects the ozone layer ([[Factory Farming]] - [[Food Systems]])

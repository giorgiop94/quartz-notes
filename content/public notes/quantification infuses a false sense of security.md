title: quantification infuses a false sense of security 
---
One possible critique of [[Effective Altruism]]'s approach.?

Surely one criticism of the traditional [[economics]] models, as also explained in [[Book - Doughnut Economics by Kate Raworth]]

This is especially important when in complex situations there are many variables that are impacted and we're not even considering. - [[what is the model ignoring]]

From [[Paper - Adapting risk assessments for a complex future (2022) by Wassenius & Crona]]
> *Quantification and probability assessments can be great tools, but in using them, we need to be cognizant that when applied to systems with high levels of randomness, they may mask the variability and infuse a false sense of security, as has been argued in financial risk analysis.*

**[[uncertainty in calculability shouldn't prevent mitigation action]]**

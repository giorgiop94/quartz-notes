*Is it possible that the contraction of craving is a result of not allowing the energy of the deeper desires to unfold and be felt?*

Rob talks about this in Opening the Dharma of Desire pt 1 of the retreat ([[Talks - Eros Unfettered - Opening the Dharma of Desire - Rob Burbea]] ), as a practice to play with when there's *dukkha*, whether or not it is obvious that there is a desire there.

"*Just let go*" is certainly an option, but it comes at a cost. What are we losing if we do so?

## 3 Steps to the practice
### 1. Ask what am I really/deeply wanting?
- Sit with the question for some time
	- Not seeking an answer from the mind, but from the whole being, the *citta*
- Unhook the desire from its immediately obvious object ([[form desire vs feeling desire]])
- Usually we find out that what we really want is something more general/abstract and deeper than our initial thought
	- In Rob's example of being upset with Gaia House's policy, he found his desire to be *freedom from constraint*

### 2. Change perspective on desire
- Clear away (negative) preconceptions (e.g. [[happiness is the absence of desire]]) of desire
- Introduce some trust in the desire
	- **Play with the idea that there might be a deeper intelligence of desire**

### 3. Open to the currents/feelings of desire
- Allowing as fully as possible the energy/stream/flow of desire throughout the *[[Energy Body Practice]]*  
- We may experience a release from the dukkha, as we find out that we already have what we're deeply desiring for

### ...shouldn't we *be with* the sense of lack?
- Sometimes, if there is is a sense of lack, we may need to be with it, feel it and care for it. But we shouldn't let that be our only or default approach
	- The sense of lack may gradually soothe
	- But doing this keeps it at a feeling of lack
- We may think that being with the lack is *being with what is*
	- But thinking so fails to see  [[emptiness|dependent co-arising]]
		- The way of paying attention to it may keep building those emotions
		- We don't see we are constructing our experience
- This practice is not about *just accepting*
	- **We are actively playing with trusting the wisdom of desire**

### Differences with Imaginal Practice
- In [[Imaginal practice]] the image is primary, it may change a bit but it is retained
	- We're not reducing the image to a meaning or representation
- In this practice, the image is secondary, the image may be regarded as a representation
	- What's primary is the deeper current of desire

## Examples
- Woman in long distance relationship desiring her partner
	- Found out she wanted the opening of the heart, wanted to love, wanted to be received
- Rob's desire made him impatient to learn more about modern physics
	- felt like he was unable to read fast enough
		- wanted to get to the end of the process
	- at first the desire seemed to want to end the inquiry, to understand all there was to be understood
	- opening to the desire opened a sense of joy to the process of inquiry itself
		- urgency was released

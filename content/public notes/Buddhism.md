> “The source of suffering is a false belief in permanence and the existence of separate selves.”  
― Thích Nhất Hạnh, Old Path White Clouds

# Key principles
- In life there is suffering (we are a bit off-balance) because of:
	1. Craving
	2. Aversion
	3. Ignorance (not aware that we live in a World of impermanence or not aware of the fact that we are all interconnected)
- everything is:
	- [[everything constantly changes (impermanence)|impermanent]]
	- [[Emptiness|empty]] [[What is the Self#Self as Empty - Anatta|(including the self)]]
		- [[we co-create our reality]]
	- [[everything is interconnected -interbeing-|interconnected]]

## Not the path of "just letting be"/no striving
> By him who knows not, who sees not as it really is (the causal uprising and ceasing) . . . training must be done . . . practice must be done . . . exertion must be made . . . there must be no turning back. . . there must be energy. . . there must be mindfulness . . . there must be earnestness. - Samyutta Nikdya, read in [[Mutual Causality in Buddhism and General Systems Theory by Joanna Macy]]

 #### Vague Path to Save All Beings
- Bodhisattvayana—the Buddhist path of compassion:
	1. Compassion
	2. ???
	3. Save all sentient beings!

#### Rejection of Power
- Power is needed if we want to create change in the World for the good of all
	- Like any tool, power can be used for good or ill

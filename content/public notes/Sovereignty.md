title: Sovereignty 
---
> Sovereignty relates to the capacity for and demonstration of good (omni-positive) [[choice-making]]. We can define sovereignty more formally as the product of sentience, intelligence, and agency. [[Daniel Schmachtenberger]]


> Sovereignty is the capacity to take responsibility. It is the ability to be present to the world and to respond to the world â€” rather than to be overwhelmed or merely reactive. Sovereignty is to be a conscious agent. [[Jordan Greenhall]]

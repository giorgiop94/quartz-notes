# Nitrogen
![Nitrogen Cycle](assets/Nitrogen Cycle.png)

- We draw nitrogen from the atmosphere and transform it into reactive forms (nitrate and ammonia)
	- Part of it goes to the biosphere 
		- Use of Nitrogen as fertilizer
	- Part goes back in the atmosphere causing air pollution, acid rains and GHG effects
	- Part of it goes back to oceans and rivers
		- Goes algae to bloom

# Phosphorus
[Phosphorus Cycle](https://biologydictionary.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Simple-phosphorus-cycle.jpg)

Caused by fertilizer application

- Over nutrient areas
	- Algae bloom, then die, causing
		- Ocean Dead Zones (potentially irreversible)

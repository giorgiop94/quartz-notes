Tension between autocratic, fast decisions and common slow ones

*how to be effective and inclusive in decision making?
can we be fast and fair?*

## Decision-making frameworks

- Importance of creating a decision protocol and making it explicit
	- **Different decision making types for different types of decisions**

### 1. Consensus
- Hear from everyone
- Use concerns and objections to improve decision
- Decision made when everyone is satisfied this was the best decision

- Pros
	- Strong buy in
	- Simple to implement
- Cons
	- Slow
	- Anyone can block (disproportionate power to each person)
	- More difficult with larger groups

### 2. Consent
- Priority to move quickly and safely
	- **Good enough for now and safe enough to try**
- Any one person can block proposals with a principled objection
	- Valid objection = "this could do harm"
- The question is not "do you love it?" but "can you live with it?"
- Process
	- Proposal
	- Clarifying questions and reactions
	- Iterate proposal based on objections
	- Decision made when no principled objections (avoid doing harm)

### 3. Advice
- Anyone can take a decision
	- If they take responsibility for the outcome
	- First they seek and **listen** to advice from
		- Experts
		- People affected
- **Encourages autonomy and collective intelligence**

#### Process
1. Announce that you are seeking advice
2. Consult with people who will be affected, and people with relevant expertise
3. Make your decision
4. Announce the outcome: ensuring people know they were heard and understood,
even if they disagree with your decision

### Mandate
- Assign limited authority to take decisions (to individuals or small groups) on a specific set of issues (e.g. marketing) and with a defined process

- Creates clarity about responsibilities
- Transparency is an important component
	- Announce the outcome: ensuring people know they were heard and understood, even if they disagree with your decision
- Best for "expertise" types of decisions

## Creating a Decision Protocol
### Factors to consider
- Risk (the more, the more people should be involved)
- Reversability (the more, the less people should be involved)
- Urgency
- Predictability (of outcome)

### Starting with experiments
- Time-limited trials
- Test different methods for different types of decisions

## Getting unstuck
Decisions inevitably get stuck sometimes

- Break the binary framework (yes/no)
	- Tends to create polarization
	- Look for more views
		- Switching to
			- I love it
			- I can tolerate it
			- I object it
- **Visualize decision-making positions**
	- Draw whiteboard
	- Move people around the room
- Seek the principle behind each position
	- Score each proposal against a list of principles
	- May be easier to agree on guiding principles
- Pause and focus on relationships
	- When someone objects a proposal, may be useful to have someone stand next to them for emotional support (in tense situations)
- Run a time-limited trial (when possible)

### Process Using Loomio
- Poll for timing
- Set up agenda points
- Count who's ready (people are prepared to meet)
	- Peer pressure to join prepared

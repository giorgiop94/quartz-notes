> The only true voyage of discovery would be not to visit strange lands but to possess other eyes, to behold the universe through the eyes of another, of a hundred others, to behold the hundred universes that each of them beholds, that each of them is - Marcel Proust 


## Transcending Paradigms is the Highest Leverage Point (Meadows)
> There is yet one leverage point that is even higher than changing a paradigm. That is to **keep oneself unattached in the arena of paradigms, to stay flexible, to realize that no paradigm is “true,” that every one, including the one that sweetly shapes your own worldview, is a tremendously limited understanding of an immense and amazing universe that is far beyond human comprehension** - [[Donella Meadows]]

> To see that God is dead and humanism dying (humanism is the humanity-centered worldview originating in the Renaissance) and to accept and celebrate this by taking **meaning-creation** into one’s own hands [[Hanzi Freinacht]]

> To have a general both-and perspective. But note that it is not either “both-and” or “either-or”—rather, it is both “both-and” and “either-or”. In each case, it is still possible to have well-argued preferences: 
>   - both political Left and Right (and neither one!); 
>   - both top-down and bottom-up governance;
>   - both historical individuals and social structures;
>   - both objective science and subjective experience;
>   - both cooperation and competition;
>   - both extreme secularism and sincere spirituality. [[Hanzi Freinacht]]


## Science
From [[Joseph Tainter]] et al: [Dragnet Ecology—“Just the Facts, Ma’am”: The Privilege
of Science in a Postmodern WorldDragnet Ecology—“Just the Facts, Ma’am”: The Privilege of Science in a Postmodern World](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/51/6/475/240648)

> The postmodern ([[Postmodernism]]) world denies science the privilege of being objective. But that does not and should not mean science has lost its privilege as something that should be taken more seriously than most other human endeavors

> We need new myths for new times, and the myth of the fair-minded, evenhanded journalist is as inappropriate as the myth of science finding the truth.

> Instead of retreating to naive objectivism, scientists need to adapt to a postmodern age by becoming conscious of the significance of their narratives. Reconceptualizing science and scientific privilege at the science–policy interface is not just exciting, it is necessary

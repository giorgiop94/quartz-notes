## Suffering as a Signal

> "Suffering is a sign that you’re out of touch with the truth. Suffering is given to you that you might open your eyes to the truth, that you might understand that there’s falsehood somewhere, just as physical pain is given to you so you will understand that there is disease or illness somewhere" [[Anthony DeMello]] #quotes 

> Suffering tells us that something is off and it's a gift, telling us that we should start to inquire [[Byron Katie]] #quotes 

> Rather than asking ourselves “Why is this happening to me? How could they treat me like this?” we find a way to stay calm and instead ask “What is this challenge trying to teach me? What can I learn from this?”. This is a big part of what they mean when they say that crisis and conflict can be transformative; it can trigger desirable transformations of our social realities and the ways we relate to one another. [[Hanzi Freinacht]]


## You Need Resistance

> "people need resistance.  If things are too easy, how will you forge your character for greatness?  What motivates the trust fund kid to start the business of his dreams?  If you are served only milk & sugar tea like royalty, how do you learn empathy and kindness?  **Just as athletes need resistance training to become strong, you need challenges early and often to become the greatest version of yourself**. " - [[Aubrey Marcus]]


## Stress Creates Adaptation
#### Hormetic Stressors
The body needs regular acute challenges.  If kids aren’t exposed to germs, their immune system won’t develop (connected to [[resilience]]).

It is not the stress that makes you stronger, it is the reaction to that stress.  That positive reaction is called recovery.   The harder you push, the more sleep you need, and the more healthy nutrients your body will require.

#### Examples
- Cold (Wim Hof)
- Hot (Sauna, Rhonda Patrick)
- Workout

#### Not overtraining
The key to adding stressors to the body is that the body must be strong enough to handle the load.  If the load is too great the body will break, and that will be a setback.  Just like overtraining in the gym.

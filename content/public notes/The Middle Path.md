## The Middle Path
[[Buddhism]]
### Meditation
Not too tight, not too loose

> Once the Buddha asked a musician how he tuned his instrument before playing. The musician said “If I tune the strings too tight they break. If I tune them too loose, no sound will come out. So not too tight and not too loose works best” 
> To which the Buddha replied “This is how you should hold your mind in meditation”.

- You need to take time off work too
- If I'm not spending time with people, enjoying myself, working on other things, will I be able to sustain working on anything at all? 
- Finding that balance and reminding yourself that it's ok.

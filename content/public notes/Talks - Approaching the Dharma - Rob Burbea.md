# Approaching the Dharma

## Ways of Looking to Liberate Us
- Insight can defined by its capacity to decrease dukkha
    - If it doesn't decrease dukkha, is not insight (one way to see it)
    - Mindfulness may not always decrease dukkha (I know I'm suffering, but continue suffering)
- Practicing with a certain way of looking (impermanence, Emptiness), over time can change our mental habits
    - Practicing with impermanence decreases grasping, attachment etc...
        - Look at all sensations coming up as impermanent
    - Mindfulness is another way of looking, it decreases Papancha
    - Other [[ways of looking]]
		- Anatta (no self)
		- [[Metta]]
			- what happens if I sustain this way of looking (also in terms of reducing dukkha)
- Insight as a result of practice (no self), can be used as the method of practice.
    - allows to consolidate the insight
    - Original insight becomes a platform for new insights

### Everything is Fabricated
- All perception is fabricated (including the sense of "self" perceiving, the sense of [[Oneness]]) 
- That things exist is one extreme, that things don't exist is another. The Buddhist path is the middle way ([[The Middle Path]])
- Any way of looking is fabricating reality
	- Mindfulness says to be with "what is"
		- the underlying assumption is that what is, is real
	- [[Emptiness]] is the most Liberating way of looking
- What fabricates the fabrications is not real either, neither is the time in which fabrications happen
- **if there is no reality, the ways of looking become even more important and relevant**
    - the malleability of our perception is way beyond what we could imagine ([[human minds are awfully malleable]])

## Other Notes
### The Path Beyond Perceptions
- We can have "inferior" perceptions
    - Anger, stress, ego
- We can have "superior" perceptions
    - Metta, Samadhi
- Or we can move beyond Perceptions

### Aviche (ignorance) 
- False belief in a separate self
	- Below the level of thought (implied in awareness "I am aware of this")
	- Causes reactivity
	- measurement, Comparison with others etc.. 
- At the root of Papancha (vortex of mind reactions)

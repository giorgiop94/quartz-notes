title: Goals in Spiritual Practice

> The goal is important only as an idea, the essential thing is the work that brings us towards the goal. [[Carl Jung]]

## We cannot totally rid of goals
- Goals are everywhere in our lives (we may not frame them that way)
	- Driving, you have the "goal" to reach somewhere without getting into an accident
	- Maintaining a relationship
- The problems is not with goals
- Problems arise due to the [[Ego]]'s measurement and comparisons with others ([[comparison trap]])
	- Notion of success invites that of failure
- We need a healthy attitudes toward goals
- **Goals give our life nobility and meaning**
- Sometimes our problem is not that we have too much desire bu that we don't have enough ([[Talks - Beauty of Desire - Rob Burbea]])
    - We are not passionate enough about anything
    - We are distracted by many meaningless desires

## Goals in Buddhism
- The Buddha used the word **striving** a lot in the sutras
- He acknowledges that in the process of striving there will be dissatisfaction, and that's ok
	- That can be included
- **[[Right Effort]]**

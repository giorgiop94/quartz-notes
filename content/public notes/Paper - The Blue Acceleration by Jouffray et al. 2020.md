> The blue acceleration is also occurring within a highly dynamic
and changing context.108,109 Climate change is already driving
fish species migrations to higher latitudes and into new jurisdictional
areas,110 forcing aquaculture to move where environmental
conditions are more favorable,35 and opening up new
areas for claims to be made, such as drilling for hydrocarbons
and new shipping routes as a result of the contracting Arctic
ice sheet

## Steps forward
> although the ocean is often considered a single unit in both
aspirational and cautionary narratives, it is highly heterogeneous
from biophysical, social, and legal perspectives. **Confronting the challenges associated with the blue acceleration therefore requires improved knowledge on where the claims are being
made, the extent of resources available, and the stakeholders
that will be affected.** The framework we present here provides a systemic view of multiple ocean claims and trends over time, but corresponding analyses of their interactions, possible trade-offs, and social-ecological consequences remain to be done. This would allow for the **mapping of areas of potential
overlap and help inform the design of integrated governance structures, such as dynamic marine spatial planning**131 

### Who are the actors?
> Second, **greater attention should be directed to the actors
placing the claims.** Previous investigations have documented a
high degree of consolidation among nations and companies
involved in the global seafood industry132,133 or in the patenting
of marine genetic resources.38 Identifying and engaging key
corporate actors behind ocean claims would allow capitalizing
on the increasing appetite of the private sector to consider
biosphere stewardship.

### Who is Financing the Acceleration?
> Third, **a focus on who and what is financing the blue acceleration
could unlock powerful leverage points** 140,141 Incorporating
more stringent sustainability criteria into ocean finance, be it
from governments,142 philanthropies,143 insurance brokers,144
banks or stock exchanges,141 would redirect capital toward
improved practices and accelerate action for a sustainable
ocean economy. Blue bonds and other impact investment tools
have emerged in recent years, but they represent only a small
portion of financial flows.

### Social & Equity Issues on Par with Environmental
> Fourth, concerns have been raised over who is to gain from
the blue acceleration. Benefits disproportionately flow to
economically powerful states and corporations, whereas harms
are largely affecting developing nations and local communities.
139,147,148 The vulnerability of small-island developing
states and least-developed countries to the impacts of climate
change faces the risk of being further augmented. Consequently,
a growing number of studies are highlighting **the need for social
and equity issues to be considered on par with environmental
concerns in discussions about ocean futures.**

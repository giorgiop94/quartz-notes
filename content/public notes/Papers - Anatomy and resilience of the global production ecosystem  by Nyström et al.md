## GPE
> The GPE is the result of three important and interacting trends: (1) the
continued conversion of the Earth’s biosphere into simplified produc
tion ecosystems, (2) the increased intensification and dependence of
these production ecosystems on human inputs, and (3) their expand
ing connectivity through global markets

### Increased (inter)connectivity
#### Increasing Scale and Speed of change  
> Although the drivers of this connectivity are
not new (for example, trade, transport, technology and consumption),
**the speed and scale at which it occurs are unprecedented**18.
Connectivity within the GPE is underpinned by long-distance
biophysical and socioeconomic teleconnections12,14. For example,
irrigation and **deforestation for agriculture in one location can redis
tribute global evapotranspiration, thereby changing rainfall patterns
and affecting terrestrial production ecosystems in other regions**19.
Increased CO2 emissions associated with deforestation20 also affect
aquaculture and wild-capture fisheries through increased seawater
temperatures and ocean acidification21. Thus, land transformation
in one part of the world can have substantial effects on production
ecosystems at distant locations, within and across sectors.

#### Global Trade Encourages Homogenization and Intensification
> production ecosystems have been further simplified
and intensified to produce products destined for global markets28

#### Leakage effects due to global trade
> As long as consistent demand exists through
globally distributed markets, implementation of policies to mitigate
overexploitation in one place—such as protected areas or reduced
quotas—may simply increase pressure elsewhere (leakage effects),
with a global net decline as a result10,32

### Homogenization
####  Concentration reduces Diversity
> There are concerns that such (corporate) consolidation reinforces global homogenization
of species (including genes, varieties and crops), practice
and knowledge39,40.

#### Land Homogenization
> In many areas, boreal forests have been simplified as a consequence of intensive silviculture
for timber production7, tropical forests have been replaced by spatially
extensive monocultures (for example, soy and oil palm plantations)43,
and native Mediterranean ecosystems have been simplified by exotic
pine tree plantations44. In grasslands, moderate intensification has
resulted in collateral biotic homogenization across microbial, plant
and animal groups, both above and below ground45. In the Amazon,
rainforest bacterial communities have become homogenized as a result
of land conversion to cattle pasture46 and in marine systems, rising
seawater temperatures have led to the rapid homogenization of fish
assemblages47.

#### Food Homogenization
[[Food Systems]]
> In agriculture, national portfolios of food supplies have seen increased crop species
diversity, whereas globally they have become more homogeneous in
composition, illustrating a shift towards a globally standardized food
supply based on a few crop types such as maize, wheat, rice and barley49.

## Loss of Resilience
degrading [[resilience]] & amplifies impact of potential shocks

>In the GPE, intensification and globalization have produced strong
interdependencies within and among sectors. In parallel, homogeniza
tion has reduced the diversity of ways in which species, people, sectors
and institutions can respond to change (loss of response diversity
)78 as well as their potential to functionally complement each other (loss
of redundancy)16,79. This suggests that the GPE possesses features that
could amplify shocks80

### Suppressing Variance blinds us and erodes resilience in the long term
[[controlling short-term variability breeds systemic vulnerability in the long run]]

> Increasing variability (variance) can be a signal of declining resilience
in complex systems, including ecosystems and social-ecological sys
tems75 but see ref. 81). Hence, intensification strategies that deliberately
suppress variance may remove a useful warning of declining resilience
in production ecosystems, sectors and the broader GPE82. Variance is
often suppressed by controlling stress and stochastic perturbations
such as grazing, fire and pest outbreaks. Such events have been proposed
to increase system resilience in the long term by selecting for
particular tolerant genes, species traits or practices83,84. Therefore, preventing
these events may gradually erode resilience, making systems
more vulnerable to disturbances that could previously be absorbed

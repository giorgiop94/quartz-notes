## What Is Ecology?
- study of [[Emergence]], [[complex adaptive systems]], self organization, dissipative nature and evolution of living systems
- study of inter-relational processes ([[process-relational worldview]])
	- relationships do not stand still, they are dynamic (danger of static models)
		- relationships evolve through communication, what is possible to communicate?
- **Ecological thinking implies humility ([[epistemic humility]]), as opposed to engineering thinking's "arrogant" implementation of correctives**
	- Nature does not do things one at a time
		- organisms change other organisms, while being changed by them, these changes happen at several orders (nth order)
			- moth with owl eyes represents a second order relationship (moth's predator are rodents, and owls are the predators' predators)
		- complexity is inconvenient to the habits of trying to get control or manage
			- thinking we can pick one thing we want to change often ends up creating a mess

- In ecology [[everything is interconnected -interbeing-]]
	- [[illusion of separation]] and of the [[What is the Self|Self]]
	- our language primes us to think of trees as separate from soil, and from fruits and from us, while there's no clear boundary for any of them - [[language shapes our world]]
	- we operate with the conception that humans are not animals and not part of nature
		- social constructs get reinforced due to [[Confirmation Bias]] and synapses getting stronger
	- need to expand our conception of self
- [[Taoism]] had understood early about the complexity of ecology, the deriving humility, and the value of following nature's way

## How to approach current predicament using Ecology
- **we don't have a lot of time if we're talking about saving "business as usual"**
- in a crisis, staying calm and helping others do the same is the main rule
	- panicking, rushing to apply (engineering) solutions is not going to help
	- engineering solution of introducing renewables hasn't delivered the progress (co2 reduction) we aimed for
- we're not making progress because we don't understand the problem well
	- we're only focusing on [[climate change]], while there are many other environmental problems all deriving from overgrowth/overshoot ([[Planetary Boundaries]])

### Unsustainability is a natural phenomenon 
- humans have it and so do every other species
- three tendencies shared by species (think of locusts, frogs, mice)
	- to grow exponentially in favorable environments
	- to expand to all available habitats
	- to use all available resources
- with fossil fuels, technology and peace humans were able to temporarily relieve the balancing feedback loops keeping their population in check (diseases, food crises, wars) and population exploded

### Contraction is inevitable
- like all other species, once available resources are depleted, population crashes again
	- all the currently proposed solutions are tiny and actually perpetuating the status quo (growth imperative model)
	- with business as usual, the population contraction won't be voluntary but imposed by nature
	- the longer we pursue these fantasized engineering fixes, the harder we're gonna fall
- It's a natural population boom-bust cycle, only this is the first time that it's on a global scale
- Human population growth is a huge taboo issue in the environmental movement
	- not about reducing population but reducing unwanted births. making contraception easily available and accessible
	- *the reason we have the taboo is that population discussion come in at the level of **control**, what we are actually talking about is **support**, that is provided to families*

## Nourishing Unintentional Communities
- A problem with intentional communities is that they have a pre-determined mission statement, which ends up being the source of conflict 
	- pressure on how people should think, be and feel
- Cultivating skills on how to be with somebody
- Shifting the personal development question
	- from "How do I develop" or "Who do I become"
	- to "**Who can you be when you're with me**" - **"How do we meet an unfamiliar and dangerous situation together"**
	- Creating a relationship such that whatever comes we can be together to address it


## Because Life
- What's the point is a wrong question
	- what's the strategy we will use? what's it for? how we're going to do it?
- What's the point of the forest? The forest is just foresting
- ==the reason for tending to life is because life==
	- all these question point to a result, to an end-point, and make us miss other possibilities

## Final takeaways
- Accepting our animal nature, and let go of human exceptionalism
	- we're stuck in a self-referencing system that insists on finding solutions from the same set of beliefs, values and attitudes that created the problem - *tautology*
	- we're in an ecological thinking pattern that's allergic to "ecological thinking"
	- we're in a context that's allergic to context
- Accepting limits of the planet we live on

title: just say yes 
---
## Decision-Making
When you are just starting out your career, you're better off saying yes to everything. 

You don't know when you'll have a breakthrough opportunity that might change your life or you might find out something that you love that you've never thought of before.

## Spirituality

Say yes to reality. Do not argue with it. [[the Universe is unfolding exactly as it should]]

> Ego exists through rejection: whenever you reject something, ego exists. Whenever you say no, ego is strengthened. **But whenever you say yes, a total yes to existence, that is the greatest meditation you can enter into**. In all other meditations you can enter but you will have to come out. This is the only meditation in which you enter and you cannot come out, because once you enter you are no more. Nobody can come out of it.

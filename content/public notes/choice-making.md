title: choice-making 
---
- What is the thing we dream of?
- 3 aspects of choice
	- *Potential* - There needs to be options to select from
	- *Selection* - One option is selected
	- *Causation* - Non-reversible outcome (if choice doesn't create change in the world it's as if it didn't happen)

### Choice vs. Decision
- Decision - de-cide - to cut off available options
	- Assume there's no win-win possible
	- Assumes completeness of information
- Choice is about increasing the field of options available until the right option becomes obvious (similar to [[Paper - Resilience as Pathway Diversity by Lade et al]])
	- Assumes we can never have perfect information
	- Assumes win-win choice is always possible (we may not be able to find it, but it exists), which makes it worthwhile to search

### Integrity/Aliveness/Meaningfulness
**How I connect to the world should build the world's integrity (aliveness/meaningfulness), my integrity and the relationship between Self and World integrity**

- Integrity as full realization of actuality (what we can do) and potentiality (what we could do)
	- (eat the cake and have it too)
	- A choice that has no actuality (no outcome), is indistinguishable from not having made a choice at all
	- A choice that restricts all your future choices (restricts potentiality), a choice that does not further (i.e. evil)
- **We want a choice that has consequences, and that begets future choices (for us an others**
- Full actuality removes all potentiality and viceversa
	- Empty garden is full potentiality and no actuality
	- We want to make actuality and potentiality work together in balance
		- **Committing to a choice but being open and flexible to changing it**
		- Being, Doing, Becoming model for Personal Development ([[Meaningful Life]])

- Sacrifice *self* for *other*, *other* for *self*, *future* for *now* or *now* for *future*, are all theories of trade-offs that don't equal the best consideration

- **A good choice is one that you can clearly think and feel through in a positive way**

## Love
> [[Love]] is that that enables choice

- Not making choices for the people we love, but enabling them
- If we love our children we want them to be wise and able to make choices on their own
- Love is irrational
	- If you tell someone "I love you because...", they will be afraid that if they stop that you'll stop loving them

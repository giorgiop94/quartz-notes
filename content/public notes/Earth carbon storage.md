title: Earth carbon storage 
---
> The total amount of carbon stored in terrestrial ecosystems is huge,
almost 60 times larger than the current annual emissions of global GHG (CO2 equivalents, 2017) by humans, and with the major part, about 70% (1500â€“2400 Gt C) found in soil ([[soil health is essential]]) (Ciais et al. 2013). The ocean holds a much larger carbon pool, at about 38 000 Gt of carbon (Houghton 2007)

> At current global average temperature, the ocean absorbs about 25% of
annual carbon emissions (Gruber et al. 2019) and absorbs over 90% of the additional heat generated from those emissions. Land-based ecosystems like forests, wetlands, and grasslands bind carbon dioxide through growth, and all
in all sequester close to 30% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions (Global Carbon Project 2019).

Land use change and extreme weather events from [[climate change]] threaten these carbon sinks

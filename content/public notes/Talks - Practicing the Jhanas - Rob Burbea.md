[Link to retreat](https://www.dharmaseed.org/retreats/4496/)

## Intro
- One month of retreat, full-time practice is not too much to learn the first Jhana
	- It can take more
- Focusing the practice at the edge of on one's practice (your playground)
- If you can get to the first Jhana, all of them are open to you
- New version: If you can get to a (pleasurable) state of Piti, all Jhanas are open to you
	- It doesn't matter how Piti arises 
- **Go with whatever practice makes it easiest for well-being to arise**
- Jhana practice includes dealing with
	- Hindrances
	- Goals
	- Difficult emotions

### Jhanas and Happiness
- Jhanas are dependent on happiness → While also leading to happiness
- Cultivating happiness and taking care of the heart
	- Orienting towards gratitude and appreciation (**feeling it**)
	- Beauty
	- Connection (with each other, nature)
	- Openness
	- Cultivating a (soulmaking) fantasy of the retreat

### Malleability and Inertia
- Jhanas are dependent on malleability → While also leading to malleability
	- Watching out for inertia and old habits in practice

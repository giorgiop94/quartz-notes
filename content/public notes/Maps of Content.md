*Maps of Content are Evolving, Fluid, Idea Incubators*

*Maps of Content are Emerging Ecosystems for Better Thinking*

I think of MOCs as evolving grounds of exploration of a topic. They are similar to table of contents in that they link to several different notes and subtopics. But unlike TOCs, MOCs are dynamic and have no fixed structure. 

MOCs may often include notes with contrasting views and in this way, they are great tools for better [[sense-making]].

## Different Ideas on Enlightenment
- [[There is no such thing as enlightenment]] - It is also empty

- [[there is enlightenment and there's what you do with it]]

- Enlightenment means realizing the truth
	- Truth seen as the experience in the present moment
	- [[Truth is never expressed in words]]
		- That's why no one can describe or point to enlightenment
		- [[the map is not the territory - misplaced concreteness -]]

- [[Talks - Questioning Awakening Rob Burbea]]

## The idea of You is an illusion, a fabrication
- [[What is the Self]]
- I is a fabrication of the [[Ego]]
	- The ego is a collection of thoughts and stories about yourself and the world
	- It creates our World - [[We see things as we are]]
	- The ego is created by what's around us 
		- [[your thoughts are not yours]]
		- [[we are slaves of the mind but don't know it]]

title: Tao Te Ching 10 - Letting Events Take Their Course

[[Book - Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu]]

## Stephen Mitchell Translation
Can you coax your mind from its wandering
and keep to the original oneness?

Can you let your body become
supple as a newborn childâ€™s?

Can you cleanse your inner vision
until you see nothing but the light?

Can you love people and lead them
without imposing your will?

**Can you deal with the most vital matters
by letting events take their course?**

**Can you step back from your own mind
and thus understand all things?**

Giving birth and nourishing,
having without possessing,
acting with no expectations,
leading and not trying to control:
this is the supreme virtue.

-------------------
## Other translations I like
Can you keep your soul in its body,
hold fast to the one,
and so learn to be whole?
Can you center your energy,
be soft, tender,
and so learn to be a baby?
Can you keep the deep water still and clear,
so it reflects without blurring?
Can you love people and run things,
and do so by not doing?
Opening, closing the Gate of Heaven,
can you be like a bird with her nestlings?
Piercing bright through the cosmos,
can you know by not knowing?

To give birth, to nourish,
to bear and not to own,
to act and not lay claim,
to lead and not to rule:
this is mysterious power. [[Ursula Le Guin]]

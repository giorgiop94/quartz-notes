title: Tao Te Ching 17 - Invisible Leadership

[[Book - Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu]]

## Stephen Mitchell Translation

When the Master governs, the people
are hardly aware that he exists.
Next best is a leader who is loved.
Next, one who is feared.
The worst is one who is despised.

If you don’t trust the people,
you make them untrustworthy.

The Master doesn’t talk, he acts.
When his work is done,
the people say, “Amazing:
we did it, all by ourselves!”

-------------------
1: [[Leadership]] - The best way of leading people is to let them find their own way
2: [[Lead by example]]

## Other translations 
### -  [[Ursula Le Guin]]

True leaders
are hardly known to their followers.
Next after them are the leaders
the people know and admire;
after them, those they fear;
after them, those they despise.

To give no trust
is to get no trust.

When the work’s done right,
with no fuss or boasting,
ordinary people say,
Oh, we did it. [[Ursula Le Guin]]

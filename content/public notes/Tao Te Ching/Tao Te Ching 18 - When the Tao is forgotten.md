[[Book - Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu]]

## Stephen Mitchell Translation
When the great Tao is forgotten,
goodness and piety appear<sup>1</sup>.

When the bodyâ€™s intelligence declines<sup>2</sup>,
cleverness and knowledge step forth.

When there is no peace in the family,
filial piety begins.

When the country falls into chaos,
patriotism is born<sup>3</sup>.

-------------------

1: [[Truly Good is Unconscious of Being Good]]
2: [[Intuition (implicit learning)]]
3: [[Patriotism is often used to manipulate]]
4: [[Yin Yang]]

## Other translations 
### -  [[Ursula Le Guin]]
In the degradation of the great way
come benevolence and righteousness.
With the exaltation of learning and prudence
comes immense hypocrisy.
The disordered family
is full of dutiful children and parents.
The disordered society
is full of loyal patriots

### - [[Stephen Addiss & Stanley Lombardo]]
Great Tao rejected: Benevolence and righteousness appear.
Learning and knowledge professed: Great Hypocrites spring up.
Family relations forgotten: Filial piety and affection arise.
The nation disordered: Patriots come forth.

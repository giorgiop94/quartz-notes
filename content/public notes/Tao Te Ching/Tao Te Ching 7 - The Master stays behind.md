[[Book - Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu]]

## Stephen Mitchell Translation
The Tao is infinite, eternal.
Why is it eternal?
It was never born;
thus it can never die.
Why is it infinite?
It has no desires for itself; 
thus it is present for all beings.

The Master stays behind; 
that is why she is ahead.
She is detached from all things; 
that is why she is one with them.
Because she has let go of herself, 
she is perfectly fulfilled. - Stephen Mitchell

## Other translations I like
Heaven will last, earth will endure.
How can they last so long?
They donâ€™t exist for themselves
and so can go on and on.

So wise souls leaving self behind
move forward,
and setting self aside
stay centered.
Why let the self go?
To keep what the soul needs [[Ursula Le Guin]]

-----------

Heaven and Earth are everlasting 
The reason Heaven and Earth can last forever 
Is that they do not exist for themselves 
Thus they can last forever

Therefore the sages: 
Place themselves last but end up in front
Are outside of themselves and yet survive 
Is it not all due to their selflessness? 
That is how they can achieve their own goals [[Derek Lin]]

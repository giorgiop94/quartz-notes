title: choose faith over fear

In the midst of uncertainty, we can choose to fear the future of to have faith in it.

We can trust that [[the Universe is unfolding exactly as it should]]. [[Embrace Uncertainty]]

> "**Both faith and fear are inherently the same**.  They are belief without knowledge.  With fear, you believe something might happen to you that is bad.  You donâ€™t know anything for sure, you just believe it. With faith, you believe something might happen to you that is good.  The winner knows how to prepare for danger, but not live in the grips of a made up nightmare.  She knows how to harbor it from reaching a deeper embodiment-- to use the signal of fear to alert her, and then let faith carry the resolution." - [[Aubrey Marcus]]

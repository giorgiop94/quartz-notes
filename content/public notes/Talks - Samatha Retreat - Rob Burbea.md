- Favorite Guided Meditation on Day 3

## Talk 1 - Intro 
- Samatha = Calmness, tranquillity
	- Healing potential
	- We fabricate less
	- Insights comes from this state
	- In Samatha you focus on what's pleasant and calming
	- In Vipassana you work with difficult emotions and sensations
	- A balance of both is optimal 
- Buddha strongly encouraged developing calmness
	- *The pleasure of calmness is a pleasure I'll allow myself*
- The more we develop it, the less needy and greedy we become
	- We also become more available to others
	- **Calmness, like other mindstates, is "developable"**
		- We are not victim of our environment for our mindstates
- The Buddha placed a strong emphasis on the 5 ethical precepts

### Questioning assumptions
- Why is there such an emphasis to not control the breath?
	- Is it to let go of the need of control?
	- Developing a breath that feels good won't really attach us to control
- **To be with things as they are is not the ultimate goal or truth**
	- The goal is something much deeper, more radical than that

## Talk 2 - How to Work with Hindrances
- **Finding calmness involves working with non-calm states**
- Hindrances affect us in meditation like in our life
	- Expect hindrances to come, they will
	- Working with hindrances in meditation as opportunity to free ourselves from them in our life
- Hindrances shrink awareness
	- Focusing on expanding awareness (related: [[Course - Alexander Technique]])
- Hindrances may come as a way to distract us from difficult emotions
	- Check in with yourself for that

### Craving
- We often don't even realize our cravings
	- We think "I need this or that"
- It's not a pleasurable state to be in
	- Feels like something is lacking
- Ask yourself
	- "What is lacking in the present moment?"
- With practice, pleasure can become so accessible and full that makes craving weaker

### Aversion

### Torpor
- Most common hindrance
- Ways to work with it
	- Upright posture
	- Remind yourself why you're practicing
	- Imagine bright light
	- Give more attention to inbreath (more energizing)
	- Open your eyes or stand up

### Restlessness and Worry
- Literal translation related to guilt over past actions
	- **Ethics is an important part of the path**
- Worry can be a habit
	- Depends on some of our beliefs
- Working with it
	- Focus on outbreath (calming)
- With time practicing, worry naturally decreases
- Too focused attention can bring agitation, too little focus can bring torpor
	- Finding [[The Middle Path]]

### Doubt
- Doubting is good in practice
- This kind of doubt is paralyzying
	- Often doubt in oneself's ability
	- Or doubt in the teaching or practice
		- Can be useful	but not during the practice
- More subtle (less physical) than other hindrances

## Talk 3 - Developing Samatha
- Concentration not a good translation
	- Gives a sense of one-pointedness of awareness
	- It can also be very expansive awareness

- Not giving in urges in practice we develop non-reactivity in life
- **Samatha creates fertile soil in our mind for insights**

### What Helps to Develop Samatha
- [[Happiness]] is what helps most to develop Samatha
	- It is also the fruit of Samatha, creating [[Reinforcing Feedback Loops]]
	- **Feeling gratitude and appreciation to develop happiness -> [[gratitude is a superpower]]**
- Receptivity, again is both a fruit and a cause of Samatha
- Learning [[Working with the Hindrances]]
	- Learning to expect and ride the waves and ups and downs

### Resistance to Practicing Samatha
1. Tightness may come up
	- We can just relax it, bring softness and kindness to the practice
	- Accepting that tightness is there  
2. Relationship with Goals [[Goals in Spiritual Practice]]
	- Goals are part of life
		- Can we learn to be in healthy a relationship with goals? 
	- Goals can be harmful when/if the diminish our sense of self-worth
		- Can we learn to keep a sense of appreciation of what we have (instead of lacking what we don't?)?
	- Goals may appear dualistic, some prefer to just abide in the present
		- A true understanding of nonduality would see that even the present moment is empty
3. Risk of Attachment
	-  Most times Samatha doesn't lead to attachment
		-  You can get attached at one level, but as practice deepens that drops
	-  Attachment to wanting to live in a nice, comfortable house is ok?
		-  Attachment to enjoying meditation is not?
4. Risk of suppressing difficult emotions
5. Doubt of usefulness of feeling pleasure

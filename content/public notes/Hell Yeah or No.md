title: Hell Yeah or No 
---
The idea is that when you have many opportunities coming at you, you decide to only say 'yes' to the really exciting things. The things that make you say "Hell Yeah", and say no to everything else.

That way whenever such opportunities arise, you'll have all the time you need to make the best of them.

This idea, however, does not apply when you don't have many opportunities, in which case it's best to [[just say yes]].

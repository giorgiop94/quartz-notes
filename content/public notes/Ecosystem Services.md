Ecosystems provide "services" such as food, water or timber, but also values that are less visible or not perceived at all.including supporting, regulating and cultural services. These were later categorised and systematised in the **Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES)**


Services that the Earth's ecosystem provide to humans and to other forms of life.
1. Provisioning goods and services
	- Food, water, wood etc..
2. Supporting Services
	- Nutrient cycles, soil formation ([[soil health is essential]]etc.. 
3. Regulating Services ([[balancing feedback loops]] for [[climate change]])
	- Pest and disease control, carbon storage etc...
	- [[Earth carbon storage]]
		- Rainforests regulate carbon sinks and rainfalls
	- Coral reefs regulate the ocean's ability to take up CO2 and its ability to circulate heat
	- Ice Caps sink methane and reflect sunlight and heat
	- Savannahs regulate temperature and sink carbon 
4. Other Services
	- Ozone layer formation (filter UV), Ice sheets (regulating temperature)

## Initiatives
the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) initiative to study the economic benefits of biodiversity and the economic costs of its degradation and loss

## IPBES' NCP
[[Nature's Contributions to People]]

> While embracing ecosystem services, NCP take a more inclusive and diverse interpretation of human-nature relations, reflecting the increasing involvement of social sciences, humanities, and other knowledge systems (e.g. indigenous, local) in global environmental science-policy interfaces. (Diaz et al 2018)

## Talk One
- As Samadhi deepens it leads to a sense of happiness, well-being and pleasure
	- Buddha placed large emphasis on it
- **Happiness leads to samadhi and viceversa** ([[Reinforcing Feedback Loops]])
- Meditation as an Art
	- No strict rules of how to respond
	- Sense of play

### Key Attitudes
- **Play**
	- Bringing play to practice every moment
	- Playing with the breath 
		- Our conception of the breath (feeling the breath coming out of our chest etc...)
		- Making breath as pleasurable as possible
- **Patience**
- Appreciation and gratitude
- Generosity
	- Reminding ourselves that we are practicing for the good of all beings

### For the Good of all Beings
- **==Creating a reservoir of pleasure and well being in practice allows us to let go and renounce material things==**
- We need less to be satisfied (food, entertainment, stuff)
- No need to be comfortable or security
- We become more available to others
	- Because we have enough
- The idea of renunciation is not scary anymore

### Not "Being with What Is"
- This practice encourages us to play with and manipulate the breath
	- This may feel not spiritual or not correct
	- Strong emphasis on being with what is
		- That kind of practice is not preparing us for daily life	
- In life we are constantly shaping and responding to things, we are not passively going through it
- **We manipulate the breath to make it as pleasurable as possible**

## Talk Two - Understanding the Heart
- Chitta - Heartmind

- 3 Components of the path
	- Mindfulness
	- Cultivation (of qualities like Samadhi, Metta, Equanimity etc...)
	- Insight (into suffering in a way that drains suffering away)

- Understanding of suffering and of happiness are both parts of the path

### Cultivation of Qualities
- Generosity
	- An open, giving heart
	- **When meditation feels dry, recall times when you acted generously**
		- It brings self-esteem, warmth, encouragement, into the moment
		- ==We need to practice generosity in our lives==
- Sila (Ethics)
	- Acting and living ethically makes us calmer, we worry less
	- People can trust us more

### Goals
- We can talk about progress in our practice
	- The qualities we developed
	- The patterns we let go of
- The idea of success brings with it that of failure
	- Our fear of failure makes us not want to think about progress

### Two More "Keywords"
- **Sensitivity**
	- Developing a light, delicate, subtle attention
	- Not forcing
	- Sensitive to the present moment, and to what we are doing in it
		- Are we adding unnecessary harshness?
- **Steadiness**

### Working with Hindrances
- Do not take the presence of hindrances personally
	- Their presence just means you're human
- Avoid getting taken for a ride by them
	- See them arise and work with them

- Torpor
	- Align the posture
	- Use long, energizing breath
	- Imagine a gold/white bright light in the middle of your head
	- Open your eyes and get a sense of spaciousness
- Restlessness
	- Again, create sense of spaciousness, expand awareness
- Greed
- Aversion
- Doubt

### On Difficult Emotions
- Is it possible that by orienting towards good feelings we suppress negative [[emotions]]?
	- Yes, possible, but there's more to it
- We have the notion that our negative emotions get stored in the body and keep coming up in meditation
- Another view, **Dependent Arising** ([[Emptiness]]), holds that emotions come up in the present moment depending on causes and conditions
	- Do emotions arise because they "have to", or is the mind contributing to let them arise? 
- **Both views can be useful**

### Different Kinds of Happiness
- Different Kinds of Happiness
	- From sense pleasures
	- From stories of the mind (if we are careful with them)
	- From letting go of the stories
	- From non-entanglement with past or future
- It's crucial for us as human beings to know these different kinds of [[happiness]]
	- Some are more fulfilling, profound than others
	- We need to taste them
- **What if we could drench our being and body in deep happiness most days of our lives?**
	- How would that affect our lives?
	- A lot of our worries would appear less relevant

## Talk Three - WIse Effort & Attachment
- [[Goals in Spiritual Practice]]
- Just being with what is can be a useful approach but can't be the only way we see our spiritual life
	- If we did, our spiritual life wouldn't resemble our real life at all
	- Our life is full of goals
	- **Goals give our life direction and meaning**

- Goals themselves are not a problem
	- The problem arises in the Self view that we create with goals
		- The Self measurement
- The Buddha used the word **"striving"** a lot
	 > It is by relying on craving that craving is to be abandoned
- Is it possible that we don't desire (awakening) enough?
	- [[Talks - Beauty of Desire - Rob Burbea]]
	- Or maybe we spread our desire to many meaningless things

### Wise Effort
#### 1. Effort towards what?
- Cultivating beautiful qualities of the mind
- Letting go and preventing unwholesome qualities 
#### 2. What's involved in Wise effort?
- Wise Attachment is involved
	- We actually need to get attached (with balance) to Ethics, Samadhi etc...
	- Is denying any attachment the most skillful way? Is it even possible?
		- A baby needs to get attached to his mother, that's healthy
	- Then we can let go of our attachment to these things
		- **We need to reach the other shore before letting go of the raft**
	- We often are afraid of getting attached to Samadhi while our lives are already full of attachments (to certain foods, our house etc....)

- The Buddha's Four Bases of Success
	1. Desire
		- Are we practicing from a "should" attitude or from a full desire?
		- Practicing from "should" ends up being dry 
	2. Persistence
	3. Intentness (being there with your full being)
	4. Ingenuity (creative responsiveness)

- [[Inner Critic]] is not involved

##### Dealing with Inner Critic
- [[Talks - Ending the Inner Critic - Rob Burbea]]
- Some degree of dissatisfaction may be skillful
- It becomes problematic when we judge ourselves harshly for not achieving our result
- **Can we judge ourselves based on intentions rather than results?**
	- We don't have full control over results ([[Internalize your goals]], [[Detachment makes you perform better]])
	- Respecting ourselves for our level of care, kindness
		- Instead of the way we look, the money we earn etc..
- Can we dwell, appreciate and cherish our beautiful aspirations, our nobility?
	- People are afraid that doing so builds the ego
	- Yet, we continue dwelling in how we are not good enough
		- Still building self, but cultivating negative states of mind

**Shifting from "essence" to actions**
- Not making conclusions about your essence based on one action you took
- What exactly am I criticizing?
- We usually judge ourselves, but that's a big, fuzzy concept
- What we are actually criticizing is a moment (of forgetfulness, unskillful action)
	- Is that moment my Self?
	- We take a micro-moment and blow it up to be our whole self
- Things arise depending on the causes and conditions ([[Emptiness]])
	- They have very little to do with self
	- **Expecting that the waves (up and downs) will come**

- Even when meditation doesn't feel good, what are we cultivating?
	- Patience, non-judgmentalism, mindfulness, spirit of questioning
#### 3. Balancing
- Continuous responsiveness of our effort ([[The Middle Path]])
	- Am I putting too much or too little effort?
	- Our attention should be like gently holding a bird in our hands #metaphor 
- Sometimes too much effort can constrict awareness and make meditation harder, create even more thoughts

## Talk Four - Jhanas
- Description of [[Jhanas]]

### Risk of Escapism?
- Pleasure in practice can be seen as an escape
- It needs to be seen as one part of practice
	- Other parts involve being with one's negative feelings
- Practicing the Jhanas also helps us develop [[Love]] and confidence. It serves as healing for the body and mind
	- We realize we can be happy without needing anything
	- Helps us [[avoid greed and compulsive consumption]]
- Buddha talked about practicing Samadhi leading to [[Enlightenment]]

## Talk Five - Concentration and Insight
- **Developing concentration, can be a preparation for insight practices** (vipassana)
	- As you go deeper you see that Samadhi and Vipassana feed each other and blend into each other
	- Samadhi is the most fertile ground for insight to take root
- Being with what is isn't the final goal of the path
- Insight meditation is "developing ways of looking that bring freedom"

### Samatha, An Act of Non-Fabrication
- Deep understanding of how the mind fabricates
	- We assume the mind receives the experience
	- In reality, the mind is constantly fabricating, by gluing pieces together
	- It can fabricate a nightmare world
	- Even the present moment, and the Jhanas are fabricated, although there's less and less fabrication in those states
- Understanding how the mind is constantly fabricating our experience, we can mold the experience
	- Fine-tuning the mind frequencies to the pleasant
	- Even unpleasant feelings can eventually be experienced as pleasant
- Sometimes we may think we're just being with what is, being with the suffering
	- But on a deeper level there's aversion there, contributing to the suffering
	- "How Am I compounding this suffering/perception?"
	- **As we relax aversion to suffering, we may see the pain beginning to fade**

- Sense of self ([[Ego]]) gets weaker in Samadhi
	- It can be a gradual process, as [[fear]] will come up

#### Practice
- If we're struggling with a difficult situation
- When we're in a state of calmness, we can try dropping in a difficult thought
	- Like dropping a pebble in the water to see its ripples
- We may find that in a state of Samatha, we have a more skillful, clear understanding of the difficult situation

- Samatha is not about denial or running away from [[Emotions]]

### Other Benefits of Samadhi Practice
- Reaching the [[Jhanas]]
- Develop
	- Confidence
	- Patience
	- Faith (in the practice)
	- Equanimity → Be with everything that's happening
	- Willingness to renunciation (because you see you don't need anything to feel good)

## Guided Meditation Notes
- Playing with the breath, but not forcing
	- Simply ask, what will it feel like if I lengthen the breath a bit, and allowing the breath to delicately change
	- Asking what's needed right now in the body, and use the breath to support
	- "What does feel best right now?"
	- Not fear mistakes, we are just playing
		- We all make mistakes and that's how we learn
	- **If you're not playing with the breath, it should be because it feels really good**
		- If it doesn't feel really good, play with it
- Possible that we feel a sense of comfort somewhere in the body
	- Using the breath to nurture that sense of comfort
	- **Consistency of attention with comfort allows it to grow**
	- We stay with what's there, and then we can allow it to spread
- No need to put pressure on it
	- The mind could get tense, not happy
- We can enjoy and be contented with whatever slight pleasure, comfort you might feel
- Awareness will continuously shrink, we should continuously expand it

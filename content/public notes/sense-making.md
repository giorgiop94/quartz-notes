> If you want an open society where everyone gets to participate in [[choice-making]] then everyone has to do a good job at [[sense-making]] (and meaning-making) - [[Daniel Schmachtenberger]]

Many of our biggest global problems are [[coordination failures - multipolar traps (Moloch)]]. If we're not able to make sense of the world in a coherent way, we won't be able to make the right decisions, particularly since the issues we face are complex and can't simply be solved analytically. 

Collective sense-making is the precursor to [[Collective Decision-Making]]. You need to make sense of the World before you can make proper decisions.

For effective sense-making, we have to be able to pick up and put down different [[ways of looking]] at issues from different perspectives.

### Why is Sense-Making an Issue?
- Sense making should be the job of science and journalism.
	- Perverse incentives of capitalism (win-lose game) cause actors to withhold or create fake information to deceive other actors.
	- **we're being optimized for the extraction of our attention**
		- The stories that get most engagement are those that reinforce existing prejudices and inspire emotional reactions, whether or not they are accurate
		- Bad-faith actors, can easily harness [[social media]] platforms to spread information that is dangerous and false.
	- Sense-making authorities are also driven by profit more than true information
	- Universities rely on corporate funding
		- Pharma companies won't invest in research unless it's something they can make money from
			- e.g. no research done on [[Psychedelics]]
- Idea of [[Information Commons]], as a "Commons" to be protected ([[Tragedy of the Commons]])

### Optimism and Sense-Making
- We don't want optimism to influence our sense-making
	- The sense-making process should be as clear as it can be
- We want optimism to come in the phase in which we try to come up with solutions
	- Then use your pessimism to judge your solutions, think of possible negative 2nd and 3rd order effects 
	- Go back and try to make it better based on the flaws you found

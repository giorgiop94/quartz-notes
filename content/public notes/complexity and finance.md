- financial markets exhibit [[tipping points]], sudden and unforeseen collapses
- [[Reinforcing Feedback Loops]] contribute to speculation-driven bubbles, crashes and [[herd behavior]]
- Rich get richer dynamics
- [[Stability breeds instability]]


### Social Network View of Financial System
- [[network effects]] matter to financial stability because shocks get amplified through cascading effects
	- **[too central to fail** issue](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00541.)
	- [DebtRank](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00541.) - a novel measure of systemic impact inspired by feedback-centrality ([[social network analysis]])
- banking network made of a small number of large, interconnected banks with very similar business models and risk profiles. Bank defaults are highly correlated
	- creates [[moral hazard]] problem as each bank knows that if it defaults, other banks likely will too and the gov is likely to intervene
	- + incentive for [[herd behavior]]
- few companies exerting significant control
	> Our results show that, globally, top holders are at least in the position to exert considerable control, either formally (e.g., voting in shareholder and board meetings) or via informal negotiations.  -  [The Network of Global Corporate Control Vitali et al 2011](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025995&fbclid=IwAR38sOuKb6W6HaSawiikiewXnsI567L7UgLMQZbiVE7kRfQx4Ybd6-ouAvk)

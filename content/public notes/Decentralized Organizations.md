	- We are not usually taught to collaborate
		- Psychological safety is the number one factor of highly productive teams

## DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Orgs)
Good definitions 
> A DAO is an internet-native entity with no central management which is regulated by a set of automatically enforceable rules on a public blockchain, and whose goal is to take on a life of its own and incentivize people to achieve a shared common mission. (Aragon)
> a community of people making decisions together in a decentralized manner, made autonomous through their software underpinnings. A DAO can be thought of as a tool that can be leveraged by communities and organizations of different types. (DAOHaus)
- Bitcoin is the most famous example of a DAO

Examples:
- Aragon
- DaoHaus

## Frédéric Laloux on a New Management Paradigm
[Sense and Respond: Frédéric Laloux on a New Management Paradigm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTgUYKsbHWk)
### The way we run organizations is broken
- Too slow, bureaucratic, not agile, innovative
- Words like care and love are repudiated
- Not the leaders' fault
	- It's the management system
	- Executives are at the edge of burnout

### Cultural Paradigms
[Lean and Agile Adoption with the Laloux Culture Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0Jc5aAJu9g)

1. Wolfpack Tribe Paradigm  *Red* (mafia)
	- Powerful leader inspires fears in enemies
	- Good for chaotic situations
	- Division of labor
2. Army Paradigm *Amber* (government)
	- Strict hierarchical structure
	- Stability and control 
	- Long-term perspective
	- Formal processes and roles
3. Machine - *Orange* (most corporations)
	- Competition within the organization and with other organizations
	- Focus on profit and growth
	- Leaders set the strategy, lower levels have some freedom 
	- Focus on innovation, accountability and meritocracy
4. Family *Green* (Ben & Jerry's)
	- Focus on delighting customers, shared values and high engagement
	- Balance the needs of all stakeholders
	- Culture over strategy
	- HIerarchical structure may conflict with people's desire for ore autonomy 
5. Living System -*Teal*
	- Anti fragile structure (flat, or evolving roles)
	- Shared goal (making the world better)
	- Distributed decision making (advice process)
	- Wholeness (safety, not being judged)
	- Self-management
	- Evolutionary purpose

### Principles for new orgs
1. Self-management (no boss-subordinate relationships)
	- Hierarchies can't deal with complex systems 
	- Still need people who can take a broad perspective
2. Wholeness
	- No need to wear a professional masks
	- When you show up partially, you also show up with part of your energy, creativity, passion and motivation
	- Simple practices can bring a sense of safety, vibrancy that allow people to show up fully
3. Evolutionary Purpose
	- Organization as a living organism with its own sense of direction
	- World is so complex that the best thing we can do is not to predict and control but to **sense and respond**
		- Following an old plan when circumstances change can be detrimental

## Samantha Slade - Going Horizontal
- Employee dissatisfaction is not actually being fixed by current practices (adding a ping pong table)
- Humans didn't evolve in formal hierarchies (tribes may have emerging, dynamic hierarchies, not formally set ones)
	- But in our workplace somehow we are forced to adjust to it
	- It's so pervasive it somehow feels natural
- Changing the company structure without changing its cultural won't work

### Three Types of Practices
- Personal (quiet and organic) practices
- Informal (collective and safe)
- Prototyping (collective and formal)

- Horizontal practices/structure often get dismissed at the first difficulty
	- Forgetting/ignoring the many difficulties in traditional structures as well

### Principles
1. Autonomy
	- Claiming your leadership
2. Purpose
	- The more explicit, the more people can be autonomous
3. Meetings
	- Show me how your meetings run and I'll explain your culture
	- How can our meetings become a fractal of the world we want to live in?
4. Transparency
	- Open is effective and efficient
	- Transparency is needed if we want to truly collaborate
5. Decision-making
6. Learning & Development
	- Self-directed and collectively held 
7. Relationship and Conflict

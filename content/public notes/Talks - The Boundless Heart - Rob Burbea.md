## Talk 1

Is it helpful to see **practice as sacred**?

- On one end yes, set it as a holy part of the day
- On the other, trying to make it special can make it counterproductive, creating expectations etc...

- **To long is to experience the pain of longing, but it is also to experience the beauty of longing.**

- **If my aspirations are bigger, little stresses in life will seem smaller, but pain from wanting to fulfill the aspiration will be there as well** [[Talks - Beauty of Desire - Rob Burbea]]

### Expectations of meditation
- we imagine in meditation there should be no thoughts
- we suffer a lot from this and other images we have of meditation
- WE WILL THINK AND THAT'S OK, IT MIGHT EVEN BE GOOD

### Point of Practice
- Developing different ways of looking
- Getting ready to work with emotions as they arise in real life 

## Talk 2 (practice starts at minute 22:30 - 40)

### What do we want from working with our emotions?
- Maybe I want the fullness of my being (an open heart)
    - Open to joy, **touched by beauty**
    - **Open to pain** and work with difficult emotions
- Not in the business of only feeling positive emotions, or don't feel emotions at all
    - Do we really want to be free of desire? 
- **Developing confidence** in our emotional life
    - often there's fear of our emotionality
    - we're in the habit of distracting ourselves from emotions

- Not just about being aware
 - not just about being with whatever feeling
 - Also about **being able to work skillfully, experiment, explore, look at the context (what are the assumptions?) **
     - Brings understanding of our emotional life

### Emotions and Mindstates
- Mindstates are subtler
    - Boredom, energized, contracted etc.. are mindstates
    - Emotions are a subset of mindstates
- If we're not aware of Mindstates we become more reactive

## Practice
- Paying attention to mindstates by focusing on the body
    - There might also be certain thoughts with each mindstate
    - Texture of the mind (spacious, energized, depressed)
- Golden question
    - **Is my mindfulness of emotions helpful or not helpful?**
    - sometimes we have reactions to emotions that make things worse

- **Energy of emotions Vs energy of attention**
    - If emotional energy is higher, we're overwhelmed by the emotion
    - if attention energy is higher we're calmer, we can heal
 
- Line in the upper body where most emotions show up (from below the belly to the head)

- Reducing emotions to body sensations is a bit simplistic
    - There's often meaning and complex parts of emotions
    - still helpful to start with the body
- Being aware of unconscious expectations
    - Expecting very clear and steady experience that matches the instructions
    - In reality it is often blurry and goes in waves (of being clear, being present being caught up in thought) 
        - recognize that waves are impermanent
        - watch them come and go like a kid in the water
        - **realize you don't drown and learn to trust these waves**
- Can we let go of the demands and expectations?

- Emotions sometimes feel like they take us over
    - They become the lens through which we see the world
- In this practice, we make emotions the object of attention
    - Awareness is bigger than emotions
    - we don't get so overwhelmed
 
- **When labeling emotions sometimes we fabricate them**
    - We label a feeling in the chest as fear and it becomes fear
    - Other times labeling can be useful
    - Not good, not bad, it's a tool


### Mind
- What is the mind doing during practice? 
- Is it constantly judging the experience as good or bad? 
    - I should be feeling this or that 
    - Again I'm feeling this way 
    - I shouldn't be distracted
        - **Good to feel distracted as it mimics our everyday life and helps us prepare for it**
    - Make conclusion about my whole life and personality 
- Instead of seeing them as a problem, it's good to see them and come up
    - These judgments come up and affect us in daily life 
    - **Good for them to come in during practice **
    - Better if we can**insert a little feeling of (great) doubt ([[The 5 Heroic Motivations]]**
- We can be aware of what the mind is doing
- Or we can **consciously introduce skillful thoughts**
    - The view of the mind affects our physical experience 
    - We can think, "What I'm experiencing right now is exactly what I need to, what I should be experiencing" 

### Practicing Short Bursts of Intense Attention
- Very difficult to maintain mindfulness over a long time 
    - It's almost a way of consciousness to bring in the past and the future
    - We can sometimes practice short bursts of energized presence
        - Chop off past and future
        - Pay attention to only this moment (25:00)

- **The mind produces thoughts like trees produce leaves**
    - we can learn to accept that and be at home with the mind
    - not judging thoughts as beautiful or ugly

## Meditator as a revolutionary
- Developing the capacity and courage to feel the pain of our times
    - hold and respond to the pain
- Practice reduces some kinds of suffering but opening the heart opens us to different kinds
- James Hillman - Psychotherapy as anesthesia
- **[[fear]] is not the same as concern** 
    - The latter has a sense of stability 
- **Part of practice is about taking risk**
    - Risk and insight reinforce each other
    - Do I have fear of speaking out?
        - Can I overcome that?
        -
## At home in the Universe
- The age of enlightenment became the age of convenience, the age of alienation and individualism
- consumerism is not just about greed, but now became a way to assert our identities
- individualism is so entrenched in today's society it might not be possible to get rid of it. How can we work with it?
	- we tend to associate our "self" with one personality
	- how can we open up our individualism, our sense of self even more in a good way?
	    - fully expressing ourselves can be a way to feel at home in the Universe.
	    - Feeling at home with existence involves opening to and accepting death ☠
- Asking ourselves:
	- Where am I seeking identity?
	- How am I expressing identity?

## Letting Go of Ways of Looking (Mystics Talk)
- It's not that hard to have mystical experiences through meditation (e. G. Oneness etc) 
    - If we don't cling too tight to them, we can allow them to unfold and evolve 
- There's always a way of looking 
    - **We assume that being with "what is", being mindful is being with reality**
         - We don't realize that this is based on a scientific materialist view
- We might dismiss God and Soul
    - Saying that those would also be impermanent
    - Impermanence is eventually not ultimate reality
    - Not permanent, not impermanent
- The problem is entrenchnent in a view 
- The more we let go, the more love, or the more we get insight into Emptiness → the smaller our sense of self, the more we experience oneness and have othrt mystical experiences
- we cling less to perception 

## Working on Emotional Body (Day 6)
- Focus on allowing, welcoming, inviting experience 
- Strong emphasis on allowing
    - Soften up experience, releasing tension
- Open up to all experience
- Notice aversion creeping in
    - **Notice that anger, fear and pain are driven by aversion**
    - Notice it 1,000 times to really internalize
- Beware of aversion dressed as "fake" allowing 
    - I want to allow to let the experience fade
- **Practice with aversion in life**
    - Take a walk under the rain

## Am I free to Inquire Talk
- Some questions are asked, but not looking for crystallized answers
    - Questions Like "Who Am I" are meant to help us find spaciousness and question assumptions
- Other questions in practice may accept answers
    - Understanding suffering, where it comes from etc...
    - What are my assumptions that lead me to suffering? 

- Allowing ourselves to inquire and question brings energy in practice, which brings concentration 
    - **If practicing with Not-knowing, is that alive? Is it with curiosity or without curiosity? ** [[Not-knowing]] | [[Uncertainty]]
- We tend to think that we can "trust our feelings" 
    - But our feelings are also affected by our conditioning and our stories

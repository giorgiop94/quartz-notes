- Humans engineered new chemical compounds that did not exist before and that no ecosystem has adapted to
	- These can be toxic substances that are not easily dissipated in the environment
	- They are often transported in long distances affecting a variety of ecosystems
- **High risk of irreversability**

### Examples of of Novel substances
- Radioactive wastes and heavy metals
	- Mercury (exposes ecosystems to high levels of pollution)
		- Problems of mercury in fish and then humans
- Chlorofluorocarbons

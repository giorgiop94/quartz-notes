1. Make sure the rest of the body is relaxed (open up the awareness)
	- We tend to tense the rest of the body in relation to discomfort
2. Make sure that the Awareness is LARGE
	- Awareness tends to shrink when we are in pain, re-establish it in the whole body
3. Stay with the area of comfort (pay attention to it more), wherever it is
	- The mind gets pulled into discomfort (we re-train it)
	- We can open and connect the area of comfort with that of discomfort
	- Try to get comfortable feelings to spread over the uncomfortable ones
4. Play with the breath
	- Fill the body with breath
5. Breathe into the pain, or make it flow through it (don't be afraid to use imagination)
	- Check what parts of the body need the breath energy
6. Become aware of fear
	- Is the fear building the pain?
7. Move the body
	- Don't go beyond your limits
8. Imagine Metta or bright light originating from the area of discomfort

title: Small actions change your self-identity 
---
The way you look at yourself (self-identity) determines how you act, what you do.

The actions you take over time determine your self-identity
- Meditate daily to see yourself as a meditator
- Workout and eat healthily to see yourself as a healthy person etc...
- Act like a leader and you'll see yourself as one
- Binge eat and see yourself as someone lacking self-control

There's the potential for strong [[Reinforcing Feedback Loops]].

It all depends on you to start setting the positive feedback loops in motion and to break the negative ones.

Also, our thinking habits determine our self-identity - [[Inner Critic]]/[[Positive Self-Talk]]

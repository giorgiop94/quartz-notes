title: thinking about success metrics 
---
[[Daniel Schmachtenberger]] talk on the Stoa

- where would optimize for this metric create problems?
	- what might we have to add
- dialectics to consider looking for higher-order synthesis
	- individual vs. collective
	- medium vs long term

**no definable metric should be optimized**
- "the dao that is optimizable is not the eternal dao" [[Tao Te Ching 1 - The tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao]]
	- defining inherently excludes other things that are valuable, and optimizing for our metric will inevitably harm what's not included

a good metric would include and transcend its measurements

- possible ideas, not to be optimized for, but to be considered in conjunction with other things
	- opposite of addiction
		- people acting from sense of agency rather than compulsion
	- [[Compersion]]

title: Systems Thinking 
---
A useful way of thinking about problems that involve [[complex adaptive systems]]

### Biases to overcome through Systems Thinking
- Stop assuming that the problem is "out there"
	- This leads us to look for a quick fix solution 
		- [[curing symptoms rather than the root cause]]
	- It shifts the focus outside rather than inside the System
- [[moving beyond cause and effect]] relationships
- shifts focus from analysing stable states to analysing transient processes
- [[more data and better models will not solve all uncertainties]]

### Ways to Influence a System (in order of importance) 
1. System Paradigms
2. System Goals
3. [[Reinforcing Feedback Loops]]
4. [[balancing feedback loops]]
5. Physical Structure

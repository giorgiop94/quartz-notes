- Negative emotions tend to swallow up the energy of attention
	- Attention becomes "depressed"
- If we can increase the energy of the attention, then the energy of the emotion decreases

- Working with emotions, we develop:
	- Capacity to hold and embrace what's difficult (important aspect of healing)
	- Confidence
	- Courage
	- Openness
- It's not an easy process, it needs, kindness, compassion, patience
	- We also need to take a lot of rest from working with emotions 

## Assumptions About Emotions
### Trauma from the Past
- **We assume that finding the underlying cause of a trauma will bring healing**
	- We also assume that the negative emotions that come up are related to past experiences
	- Rob had a lot of catarthic experiences, crying etc... but it didn't bring lasting changes
	- A lot of creating the difficult, just to heal it
		- But he would still go through all that
		- The process also brought a lot of heart opening
			- Rob is hesitant to discourage people from this kind of work
- This view misses the dependent arising in the present
	- There are causes and conditions in the present that make those emotions come up

### Feeling Through Always Brings Healing
- We assume that just [[Feeling Through Emotions]] is healing, but that may not always be enough
	- **Sometimes attending to the difficult (giving attention to the problem) may feed it **
	- There's a case to be made for **skillful not attending** (and instead focus on metta, nature, breath)
- Rather, healing depends on the relationship we have with emotions in the present
	- Nurturing a healthy, beautiful, balanced relationship with what's there
	- **Even when there's something difficult, we can bring sweetness and kindness to our attention**
- **Kindness is key**
	- Can I meet myself and the emotions with kindness?
	- Let go of any wish for it to go away

## Mindfulness and Cultivation
- Mindfulness is one wing of practice, the other wing is **Cultivation**
	- Cultivating beauty, kindness, metta, Samadhi, wonder
		- These qualities are builders of happiness
	- Am I looking at these two as two balanced processes (mindfulness and cultivation)?

## Emptiness
- [[Emptiness]] practice
- "Whatever's happening is not mine, not me, not myself"
	- Not even the awareness is me or mine
	- Eventually experiences start to dissolve
	- Can healing occur if no difficulty is arising?
	- **The amount of stuff that comes up is in relation to how much Self I am fabricating**
- Even the past is empty, we are co-creating our emotions in the moment with our views
	- The views we have on Self, on others, on the past etc...

## Dangers in Every Practice
- All practices are ways of looking to be picked up and put down, they all come with risks or downsides
	- Psychotherapy may be tremendously useful
		- But it can also build up too much Self (over-emphasis on oneself)
			- One can become too entitled
			- Fits right in the "me-obsessed" culture
	- Danger of Vipassana's laser-focused attention
		- May bring hardness and disconnection from emotions

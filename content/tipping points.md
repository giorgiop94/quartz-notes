When a system fundamentally changes structure and function, settling into a new stable state.

- Nonlinear effects
	- Can have very big consequences
- Not easy to reverse
- Difficult to predict


## Feedback Loops
- Feedback loops keep the system in its stable state
	- As feedback loops change direction or if the feedback loop of the alternate regime become increasingly strong they can create sudden changes
	- Systems that have higher [[resilience]] will be more resistant to regime shifts

### Example of Rainforests
- Water-generating feedback loop
	- High density of plants traps moisture and generates rainfall
	- Rainfall allows vegetation to thrive
- As you cut down the forests, you break the feedback loop, and set it in the opposite direction
	- No plants to trap heat, no rainfall, less plants, less rainfall etc...

## Example of Coral Reefs
- shifts from diverse coral reefs
	- dominated by coral, have rich fish populations,
	- supporting lots of tourist industries
	- protect the coast from storms;
-  to algae-dominated reefs
	-  much less fish often, much smaller fish, and not diverse community of things
	-  big impacts for both the ability of local people to persist, and on the conservation of nature.

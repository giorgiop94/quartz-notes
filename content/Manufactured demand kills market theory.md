title: Manufactured demand kills market theory 
---
- Asymmetry of power and resources between businesses and consumers
	- Each consumer is on its own against trillion dollar organizations
- **Manufactured demand kills market theory**
    - Demand doesn't represent [[collective intelligence]]
    - Scientifically optimized psychological manipulation (with AI)
		- We want stuff that we don't need or won't increase the quality of our lives
		- People buy not only in terms of quality and price
			- Hyper normal stimuli in advertisement matters

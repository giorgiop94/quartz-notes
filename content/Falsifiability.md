title: Falsifiability 
---
Falsifiability is the assertion that for any hypothesis to have credence, it must be inherently disprovable before it can become accepted as a scientific hypothesis or theory.

It doesn't mean that you have to prove it's wrong, but you have to be able to prove whether it is wrong or not.

- For Popper, that's what **differentiates Science from Pseudo-science** (at the time he talked about [[Albert Einstein]] vs. [[Sigmund Freud]])
- **Science makes predictions that can be proven wrong** (falsifiable)
	- Using data to make future predictions
- Pseudo-science uses past data to explain the present
	- You can fit your beliefs into the data to confirm your existence
	- You can always find data to confirm a point

- For Popper, Science disconfirms a hypothesis, while pseudo-science confirms theories

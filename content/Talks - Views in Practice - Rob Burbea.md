title: Talks - Views in Practice - Rob Burbea 
---
- beginning investigating and uncovering the views we have and what effects they have
- what do we believe about life? How are wee looking at it?

## Exploring one's views
- right view as the beginning and culmination of the path
- 4 noble truths
	- is there suffering? Where is the grasping? Is it possible to relax it? 
	- what am I putting in in the present moment that's adding to the suffering?
		- suffering needs inputs in the present to manifest
		- idea of negative emotions bubbling up from the past (can be useful), can we question it? 
- what brings freedom/happiness/nourishment (Part of right view in long term)
	- do I know what leads to happiness? 
	- **happiness in the moment may not be possible, but it can be a long term agenda, cultivating the qualities that have happiness as their fruit (generosity, calmness, renunciation etc...)** 
- Sila as foundation for happiness
	- taking care of how we are with other people
	- the path makes us more sensitive to how we act
	- we develop sensitivity to sila
- right view in the moment
	- we tend to prioritize fixing the external issues (very important but gives sense of hassle) 
		- notion of "how can I see this (difficult moment) differently" takes the back stage
	- how can I see this in a way that it moves towards freedom? 
		- how can I practice with this? 
		- 3 characteristics
	- ==when there's suffering, it means that we're looking wrongly==
		- Joseph Goldstein: "When there's suffering, that tweaks my interest"
			- I need to look at something differently

## no attachment to views
- how much argument and wars come from having different views 
- **basic teaching: don't get attached to views**
    - can't put one view over another? 
    - is ultimate reality a big pink fish named Barbara? 
	    - maybe not all views are completely equal

### can we have "no view"?
- other teaching: right view is no view
    - appealing, very simple, feels nice
    - but there is always a view going on
    - are we really interested in truth or just in feeling "nice"?
    - most of the times we are not aware of our view
        - self view can be strong
        - life is suffering
    - **what views have we absorbed from the (modern secular) culture?** 
        - have we replaced religion with meaningless, nihilistic views? 
        - we have a view all the time
            - adding "me and mine" to all experiences
            - any kind of self view is a builder of experience 
            - seeing emotions as coming up from the past

### "nothing to do" view
- other view/teaching: nothing to do, nowhere to go, just be with what is, letting go (beautiful, true teaching but only part of the path) 
    - can lead to stop practicing 
    - on hearing that most people come back to me here
    - capacity to let go is supported by the beautiful qualities we cultivate
    - being vs. doing duality is not ultimately real
        - we are building reality with even the subtlest view

- some people say: "I don't meditate, relationships/parenting/music/dancing/art etc...is my path"
    - those are beautiful practices and sometimes the sense of self may disappear
    - but do they bring the realization that all is empty?
    - but Dharma practice does have an agenda the realization of emptiness
        - it is not just about being in the moment or losing oneself
        - can what I'm taking to be practice take me to that insight?

## Careful to drop all concepts
- the buddha did say that realizing emptiness is to let go of all views
    - we might be tempted by the simple conclusion to drop all concepts
    - if we ditch concepts too early, we end up with all the default concepts (me, you, mine, world, thing, thought, emotion, time)
    - **the genius of the Buddha was to suggest a few concepts that lead to freedom and beyond all concepts** (snake eating its own tail, wood burning itself, need to reach the shore before letting go of the raft)
        - 4 noble truths

## Emptiness and Ways of Looking
- [[Ontology]] as the views and beliefs we have on what is real and not real (dreams vs. waking reality)
    - **whether we philosophize or not we always have an ontology**

- [[ways of looking]] = in any moment how are we relating to something
    - all the ideas, concepts, assumptions, reactions, tendencies, beliefs, likes, dislikes, kinds of attention together make up the way of looking
    - we have the possibility to explore that consciously and extend the range of our ways of looking
    - different ways of looking have different amounts of clinging and fabrication
- It's impossible to rest from ways of looking
    - anything we sense at all is always experienced through a way of looking (even if we're not deliberately playing with one)

## Ontology and conceptions of reality in dharma practice
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ghgV508vOSabUinBrh8Gx1JVQSmzkYNt/view

- Ontology is anything but abstract and really fundamental for practice
    - What happens in our lives once we decide that X is real and Y isn't

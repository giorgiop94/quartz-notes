title: reductionism

Assumption that: *the whole is equal to the sum of its parts*

Attitude of [[Modernism]] and industrialism of reducing things to their components, functions and what can be measured, losing sight of the whole. An almost opposite perspective is [[Systems Thinking]]. 

### Scientific reductionism
> “The aim of [[mode science|science]] is to seek the simplest explanations of complex facts. We are apt to fall into the error of thinking that the facts are simple because simplicity is the goal of our quest. The guiding motto in the life of every natural philosopher should be, **seek simplicity and distrust it**”. [[Alfred North Whitehead]]

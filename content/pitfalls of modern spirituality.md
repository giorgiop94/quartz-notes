## Rob Burbea on Modern, Mainstream Buddhism in the West
- Common western, [[consensus buddhism]] is so obsessed with the **individual's** inner growth and path
    - End up missing the outer socio-economic-environmental crises
    - Can reinforce the sense of separation
- [[Oneness]] lend itself to a kind of equanimity (that is held as THE goal)
    - If everything is one it doesn't matter if that forest dies
        - "[[the Universe is unfolding exactly as it should]]"
    - Easy for it to be taken too far (**not wrong, but incomplete**)
- [[Archetypes]] are extremely limited
    - Only calm Buddha, where is the warrior, the erotic?
    - That single archetype won't be enough to fire up activists
- The basis of Buddhist teaching ([[Four Noble Truths]]) focus on "healing of suffering"
- Quieting, reducing or healing the Self
    - Different than growing the wildness, uniqueness, individuation of the Self
- Mindfulness is one approach, we need flame, passion, sexuality and much more

[[Forrest Landry]] and [[Daniel Schmachtenberger]]

## Morality vs Ethics
- What differentiates morals from ethics?
	- Moral looks like context specific **rules** (e.g. 10 commandments)
	- Ethics is expressed in general **principles**, from which morals can be derived (e.g. "Treat others as you'd like to be treated")
		- Principles are more general and abstract but can be translated into any context
		- Principles can help us devise and update rules as the environment changes

## Objective, Existing or Real?
[[ontology]]

- Exists: Content/context relationship

- Objective: measurable by more than one person (intersubjective)
	- Basis of the [[science|scientific method]]

- Real: Subject object relationship/interaction (capacity to sense)
	- Choice and ethics rely on what's real more than what's objective (?)
	- Not necessarily looking at what's repeatable, but unique situation


## Symmetry & Continuity

### Symmetry
- Sameness of content, difference of context (water bottle has same amount of water before and after you drive it to a friends' house... *conservation law*)
- Scientific laws are formulated around the concept of symmetry, using the = sign
	- Allows to predict the future in some situations
		- Not useful for subjective problems/questions
		- Doesn't allow us to know what is better

### Continuity
- Sameness of content, sameness of context (concept of no abrupt shifts)
	- Useful for subjective perspectives
	- Inner subjective experience has a continuity (I feel the same person as I was yesterday)
		- [[Neuroscience]] takes a third person (symmetry) perspective on subjective experience, not a good proxy for the first person perspective

### Ethics
- Symmetry concepts dominated the discussion because external phenomena are easier to see
	- Many of our ingrained assumptions are based on symmetry
- Today's problems require a different approach to deal with them
- [[Utilitarian ethics]] is dominating the discussion using the concept of optimization, not accounting that the context is continuously changing (what worked in the past won't necessarily work)
	- 2 contexts we should take into account: The world, the subjective (previous experiences, choices, values)
- **[[choice-making]] more as a search problem, than an optimization one**

- Symmetry ethics: I deal with you in a way that I'd be willing to be on the other side of the deal
	- Golden rule
	- I slice the pie you choose
	- Talking about a topic, I should say the same thing whether I talk to this person or this other (otherwise it would be a deceit)

- Continuity ethics (concept of time is involved)
	- Giving notice before leaving an apartment
	- Severance after firing an employee
	- Talking through decisions before making it
	- The same person (subjective context is the same) in the same situation (same objective context), should respond (content of expression) in the same way
		- In a slightly different situation I should respond in a similar way and be able to account for the difference

## Choice
- Choice as a search function, not an optimization one
	- What is the thing we dream of?
- 3 aspects of choice
	- *Potential* - There needs to be options to select from
	- *Selection* - One option is selected
	- *Causation* - Non-reversible outcome (if choice doesn't create change in the world it's as if it didn't happen)

### Choice vs. Decision
- Decision - de-cide - to cut off available options
	- Assume there's no win-win possible
	- Assumes completeness of information
- Choice is about increasing the field of options available until the right option becomes obvious
	- Assumes we can never have perfect information
	- Assumes win-win choice is always possible (we may not be able to find it, but it exists), which makes it worthwhile to search

### Integrity/Aliveness/Meaningfulness
**How I connect to the world should build the world's integrity (aliveness/meaningfulness), my integrity and the relationship between Self and World integrity**

- Integrity as full realization of actuality (what we can do) and potentiality (what we could do)
	- (eat the cake and have it too)
	- A choice that has no actuality (no outcome), is indistinguishable from not having made a choice at all
	- A choice that restricts all your future choices (restricts potentiality), a choice that does not further (i.e. evil)
- **We want a choice that has consequences, and that begets future choices (for us an others**
- Full actuality removes all potentiality and viceversa
	- Empty garden is full potentiality and no actuality
	- We want to make actuality and potentiality work together in balance
		- **Committing to a choice but being open and flexible to changing it**
		- Being, Doing, Becoming model for Personal Development ([[Meaningful Life]])

- Sacrifice *self* for *other*, *other* for *self*, *future* for *now* or *now* for *future*, are all theories of trade-offs that don't equal the best consideration

- **A good choice is one that you can clearly think and feel through in a positive way**

## Love
> [[Love]] is that that enables choice

- Not making choices for the people we love, but enabling them
- If we love our children we want them to be wise and able to make choices on their own
- Love is irrational
	- If you tell someone "I love you because...", they will be afraid that if they stop that you'll stop loving them

### Clarity & Desire
- If I want to be in right relationship with other people I need to be in right relationship with myself (among my parts)
	- Develop continuity of self
	- Developing clarity
- Buddhist idea that "desire is the cause of suffering", may be mostly referring to desires that are not fully clarified. 
	- Clarity in desire
		- [[form desire vs feeling desire]]

## Meaningfulness
- Notion of Meaningfulness contingent on a first person perspective
	- Not about "this is only meaningful if they'll remember it after 100 years"
	- About "Am I appreciating and honoring the gift of life?" ([[Meaningness]])

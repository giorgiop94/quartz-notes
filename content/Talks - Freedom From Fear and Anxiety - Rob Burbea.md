title: Talks - Freedom From Fear and Anxiety - Rob Burbea 
---
Even the Buddha talked about feeling great fear when he was practicing in the forest (before his enlightenment) and heard some noise

**Fear is workable, freedom from it is possible**

Inverse relationship between fear and love (fear shrinks, love expands).
Direct relationship between fear and violence.

Asking oneself with kindness: 
- Am I challenging fear enough?
- How constricted is my life by fear?

## Fear Mechanisms
### Fear-Aversion 
Our natural tendency to run away from fear only makes it worse

- Often we have aversion to fear
	- We're afraid of feeling it
- We escape the sensations in the body and our mind takes over
	- Thoughts start spiraling increasing fear more

### Self-Judgment
- What is the underlying assumption when feeling fear?
	- I shouldn't feel it
	- I'm too old, mature to be afraid of this stuff
- Are you subtly judging yourself for that fear?
- The [[Inner Critic]] creates a breeding ground for fear and anxiety
- **Many fears comes from a lack of self-love**

### Colors Reality
- Fear doesn't only affect us, it affects reality as we experience it ([[everything is interconnected -interbeing-]])
	- The thing we're afraid of looks more scary when we're afraid 


##  Mindfulness of Fear
**Developing the capacity of accommodating unpleasant sensations**

- Of sensations in the body
	- What does it feel like?
- Mental reactions to fear	
	- Spinning thoughts about the future
	- Aversion to fear (fear of fear)
	
### Creating Spaciousness	
- Fear constricts the mental space (we just focus on what we're afraid of, often vague, undefined fears)
	- Practicing mindfulness opening a sense of spaciousness
- If the fear is very persistent and ongoing
	- It can be skillful to not dwell on it
		- Get mental space by doing something else (sports, creative endeavours)
	- Then maybe come back to it

### Kind Acceptance
- Practicing emphasizing kindness and acceptance
	- Of oneself, and the fear
	- Can we embrace fear with kindness like a hurt child?
- **We're deliberately undermining aversion of fear**
	- It takes practice

## Challenging Fear More Directly
### Actions
- Going against fear
	- If fear says not to do it, we do it, and viceversa
- Finding out what kinds of fear you generally have and playing with them
	- Do you have fear of being too generous? Play with it!

### Thoughts
- What am I believing in situations of fear?
	- What assumptions am I making?
	- Challenging fearful thoughts
		- Are those true?
		- Even if so, So what?
- Why are we so obsessed with others' approval and [[fear of judgment]]?
	- Maybe we don't have an inner reserve of well-being
	- How can we develop that?

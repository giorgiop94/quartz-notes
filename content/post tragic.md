There's a pre-tragic optimism that people have before their ideals get shattered by the reality of the world (naivete).

Cynisism emerges once one encounters the reality of the world and their ideals are shattered.

Post-tragic - **committed to being in service of the sacredness of life whether you can succeed or not. Cognizant of all the tragedies (and holding them), we still look for solutions, while operating with the sacredness of life at the center.

title: Book - The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins 
---
- Genes are self-replicating machines with the ultimate goal of surviving and reproducing
	- Strong genes survive and weak ones die
		- Strong genes created cells to protect themselves from each other
		- Eventually they created ever-more complex organisms (plants and animals) for protection, survival and reproduction 
- A gene is a tiny part of the DNA (gene for blue eyes)
	- For each gene, each of us possesses the dominant one and the allele
- The DNA is made of 46 chromosomes and is present in each cell of our body
	- The DNA is like the MasterPlan of a Building, and our body is the building

#### The master plan is contained in every room (cell) of the building (body)

### Why Selfishness Survives

- [[Group selection theory]] argues that groups that were more altruistic and better able to cooperate would survive over groups whose individuals were selfish and could not cooperate
	- That seems true, BUT, within those groups the more selfish people who deceived others into thinking they were altruistic would have a better chance of survival and reproduction (they would cheat on wives etc....)

#### The Same Things Happened Society Wide ([[Daniel Schmachtenberger]])
Peaceful cultures ([[Jaininsm]]) and memes got wiped out or didnt spread 
	- [[Propagative memes propagate more than true memes]]

## Principles
- Do not take rushed decision (if decision requires you to be rushed and you can avoid taking the decision, avoid it) 
- ·Distinguishing what action is coming from the mind and what from the body
	- Not necessarily judging either as better
	- Knowing what's coming from where can help with decisions
- [[Decision Journals]] help us mitigate some of the biases in our decisions
	- [[narrating self and experiencing self]]
- Look to falsify the beliefs you hold to be true to counter the [[Confirmation Bias]]
	> "If that's not the way you are thinking you will not be successful, except by accident" - *[[Annie Duke]]*

	- Looking for the things we don't know can help us to deal with both of our information issues
		- The Information we have is limited and often wrong
	- [[Falsifiability]]
- Keep in mind [[Cognitive Bias]]


### Good Decisions vs Good Outcomes
- The two things are very different
	- We cannot assess decision quality objectively
		- Instead, we can assess the outcome of that decision
		- The problem is that we tend to mistake a good outcome with a good decision and viceversa

## Frameworks
- [[Hell Yeah or No]] vs. [[just say yes]]
- [[the map is not the territory - misplaced concreteness -]]
- [[What you want now vs what you want most]] 
- [[Collective Decision-Making]]
	- Consensus
	- Consent
	- Mandate
	- Advice
- [[Robust Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty]]

## Heuristics
- Affect
	- Letting one's emotions significantly impact the decision
	- Researchers have found that when you are in a positive emotional state, you are more likely to perceive an activity as having high benefits and low risks
		- If your emotional state is negative, on the other hand, you are more inclined to see the activity as being low in benefits and high in risk.

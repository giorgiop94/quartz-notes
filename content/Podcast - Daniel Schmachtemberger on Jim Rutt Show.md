### Can we Fix Our Democracy?
We need to all get supereducated
- Real [[Democracy]] emerged following cultural enlightenment with few things in common 
	- Athenian democracy 
		- [[Stoicism]] - emotional regulation (argue without emotions getting involved), have the courage to disagree
		- socratic method - take each other's perspective 
		- [[Aristotle]] - Logic, rhetoric and History
- Idea of [[Memetic immune system]] (emotionally as well) as an antidote to [[Memetic Virus]] spread through [[social media]]

### Any Alternatives?
- Idea of enlightened AGI Global Monarch
	- Monarchy (and dictatorships) is better at long term planning because 
		- there are no incentives to do short term wins for re-elections
		- Concern for sons of king â†’ more concern for future

### The value of uncertainty for [[sense-making]]
- UNCERTAINTY is needed for better sense making (minute 50) [[Embrace Uncertainty]]

Before and after any Important Decision Ask yourself:

- What information I knew, or was knowable, beforehand?
	- Could I have know other relevant information at a reasonable cost?
- What decision did I make?
- What things were revealed afterwards?
- What was the outcome?
- What other outcomes could have happened and what were their probabilities?

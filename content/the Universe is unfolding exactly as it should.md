title: the Universe is unfolding exactly as it should 
---
According to this idea, we have nothing to worry or be anxious about.

The Universe (Nature) is perfect, or if not perfect, a lot smarter than us. So who are we to judge if something is going to be bad?

We can just trust that whatever is unfolding in The Universe is perhaps the best thing that could be happening. [[just say yes]]

> “You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And **whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.”** 
> – Max Ehrmann

#### Maybe things are ok Song

> *No snowflake ever falls in the wrong place,
no gnarled tree ever grows in the wrong way,
no joint smoke ever drifts to the wrong spot,
and no mind ever produces the wrong thought.*
 
>*No bird ever soars in the wrong breeze
and no flower ever attracts the wrong bees,
No cloud ever drifts to the wrong sky,
and no grandma ever bakes the wrong pie*
 
> *So maybe things are unfolding as they should be.
Maybe things are unfolding as they should be.
Man, I see you thinking about how things could be, 
but I'm just saying I think things are unfolding as they should be*

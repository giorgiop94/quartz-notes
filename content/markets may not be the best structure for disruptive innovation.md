title: markets may not be the best structure for disruptive innovation 
---
- Are markets not the best structure for deep innovation?
- **Many of the most revolutionary innovations were created by governments**

- **Market are better at solving and finding unknown whats**
	- VC is not going to put money in revolutionary, but uncertain long term project
		- VC looks for (relatively) short-term opportunities to exploit
	- Nuclear fusion and other important innovations require investment too large on too long time scales (for the market to be involved)
	- Markets are better able to explore different options at the edges (unknown), and find the best solution

- **Central organizations better to solve known whats** (that require large investments and long time horizons)
	- Examples of internet, the Manhattan Project, NASA
	-

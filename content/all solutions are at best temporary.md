title: all solutions are at best temporary 
---
**Any solution is going to inevitably be temporary. Having a set of guiding questions that are asked over and over can help us continuously adjust dealing with the unpredictability of the all**

From [[Book - Designing Regenerative Cultures - Daniel Wahl]]
> In our learning journey of human survival and our quest for a thriving regenerative culture, **all answers and solutions will at best be partial and temporary**. **Yet by asking the appropriate guiding questions repeatedly and entering into conversations** about our collective future in all the communities we participate in, we may be able to find a set of patterns and guidelines that will help us to create a culture capable of learning and transformative innovation. 

> Guiding questions are a more useful way to chart such a continuous transformative path than fixed answers. This does not mean we do not have to propose answers and implement solutions; we simply have to be aware that they will only serve temporarily.

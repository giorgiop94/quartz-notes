title: Practice Discomfort 
---
## Physically
Idea from [[Stoicism]] about intentionally putting oneself in uncomfortable conditions for a certain amount of time.

Twofold gains:
- You stop fearing hypothetical futures because you experienced them and know you can bear them
	- Most fear is [[fear of the unknown]], but once you experience it is not unknown anymore
	- You learn that you can adapt to pretty much anything
- You appreciate more what you normally have

## Emotionally
- You get better at doing that thing ([[The more you do something the easier it becomes]])
	- most things in life are skills that can be developed through practice and repetition
- You change your self-identity ([[Small actions change your self-identity]])
	- the more you do things that seem uncomfortable (e.g. public speaking) the more you see yourself as the person who does that kind of thing

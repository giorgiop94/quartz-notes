### Summary Quotes
*if everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it?* Moloch

▪ Moloch is exactly what the history books say he is. He is the god of child sacrifice, the fiery furnace into which you can toss your babies in exchange for victory in war. He always and everywhere offers the same deal: throw what you  love most into the flames, and I can grant you power. As long as the offer’s open, it will be irresistible. So we need to close the offer. Only another god can kill Moloch. We have one on our side, but he needs our help. We should give it to him.

▪ **Once one agent learns how to become more competitive by sacrificing a common value, all its competitors must also sacrifice that value or be outcompeted and replaced by the less scrupulous. Therefore, the system is likely to end up with everyone once again equally competitive, but the sacrificed value is gone forever. From a god’s-eye-view, the competitors know they will all be worse off if they defect, but from within the system, given insufficient coordination it’s impossible to avoid.**

▪ A basic principle unites all of the multipolar traps above. In some competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw some other value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it prosper. Those who don’t take it die out. Eventually, everyone’s relative status is about the same as before, but everyone’s absolute status is worse than before. The process continues until all other values that can be traded off have been – in other words, until human ingenuity cannot possibly figure out a way to make things any worse.

Multipolar traps – races to the bottom – threaten to destroy all human values. They are currently restrained by physical limitations, excess resources, utility maximization, and coordination.

## Examples of Traps

### Education
▪ People ask why we can’t reform the education system. But right now students’ incentive is to go to the most prestigious college they can get into so employers will hire them – whether or not they learn anything. Employers’ incentive is to get students from the most prestigious college they can so that they can defend their decision to their boss if it goes wrong – whether or not the college provides value added. And colleges’ incentive is to do whatever it takes to get more prestige, as measured in US News and World Report rankings – whether or not it helps students. Does this lead to huge waste and poor education? Yes. Could the Education God notice this and make some Education Decrees that lead to a vastly more efficient system? Easily! But since there’s no Education God everybody is just going to follow their own incentives, which are only partly correlated with education or efficiency.

### Government corruption
▪ I don’t know of anyone who really thinks, in a principled way, that corporate welfare is a good idea. But the government still manages to spend somewhere around depending on how you calculate it) $100 billion dollars a year on it – which for example is three times the amount they spend on health care for the needy. Everyone familiar with the problem has come up with the same easy solution: stop giving so much corporate welfare. Why doesn’t it happen? Government are competing against one another to get elected or promoted. And suppose part of optimizing for electability is optimizing campaign donations from corporations – or maybe it isn’t, but officials think it is. Officials who try to mess with corporate welfare may lose the support of corporations and be outcompeted by officials who promise to keep it intact. So **although from a god’s-eye-view everyone knows that eliminating corporate welfare is the best solution, each individual official’s personal incentives push her to maintain it**.

### Democracy (disconnect between good policymaking and electability)
▪ I think it is less well appreciated that democracy has the same problems. Yes, 
in theory it’s optimizing for voter happiness which correlates with good policymaking. But as soon as there’s the slightest [[disconnect between good policymaking and electability]], good policymaking has to get thrown under the bus.

### Capitalism
▪ Like the rats, who gradually lose all values except sheer competition, so companies in an economic environment of sufficiently intense competition are forced to abandon all values except optimizing-for-profit or else be outcompeted by companies that optimized for profit better and so can sell the same service at a lower price.

## Moloch Is in Control
▪ Any human with above room temperature IQ can design a utopia. The reason our current system isn’t a utopia is that it wasn’t designed by humans. Just as you can look at an arid terrain and determine what shape a river will one day take by assuming water will obey gravity, so you can look at a civilization and determine what shape its institutions will one day take by assuming people will obey incentives.

### Moloch Runs Capitalism
**“capitalists sometimes do bad things”** isn’t exactly an original talking point. But I do want to stress how **it’s not equivalent to “capitalists are greedy”**. I mean, sometimes they are greedy. But other times they’re just in a sufficiently intense competition where anyone who doesn’t do it will be outcompeted and replaced by people who do. Business practices are set by Moloch, no one else has any choice in the matter

## Moloch Restrainers
The limit of multipolar traps as technology approaches infinity is “very bad”.

Multipolar traps – races to the bottom – threaten to destroy all human values. They are currently restrained by physical limitations, excess resources, utility maximization, and coordination. 

### physical limitations
**Physical limitations** are most obviously conquered by increasing technology. The slavemaster’s old conundrum – that slaves need to eat and sleep – succumbs to Soylent and modafinil.

### excess resources
**Excess resources**, which until now have been a gift of technological progress, therefore switch and become a casualty of it at a sufficiently high tech level. (Note: once we don't have excess resources the races to the bottom will become much harsher)

### utility maximization
Comment: As tech improves, continuing to maximize utility is increasingly likely to threaten human values
- Human labor substituted
- Improved weapons
- Improved propaganda

▪ technology increases the efficiency of manufacturing consent in the same way it increases the efficiency of manufacturing everything else ([[Manufactured demand kills market theory]])

### coordination
**Coordination** is what’s left. And ==technology has the potential to seriously _improve_ coordination efforts.== People can use the Internet to get in touch with one another, launch political movements, and [fracture off into subcommunities](https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/Archipelago-And-Atomic-Communitarianism).

But coordination only works when you have 51% or more of the force on the side of the people doing the coordinating, and when you haven’t come up with some brilliant trick to make coordination impossible.

#### Slavery Example In-Depth
▪ Imagine a profit-maximizing slavemaster who decided to cut costs by not feeding his slaves or letting them sleep. He would soon find that his slaves’ productivity dropped off drastically, and that no amount of whipping them could restore it. Eventually after testing numerous strategies, he might find his slaves got the most work done when they were well-fed and well-rested and had at least a little bit of time to relax. Not because the slaves were voluntarily withholding their labor – we assume the fear of punishment is enough to make them work as hard as they can – but because the body has certain physical limitations that limit how mean you can get away with being. Thus, the “race to the bottom” stops somewhere short of the actual ethical bottom, when the physical limits are run into. John Moes, a historian of slavery, goes further and writes about how the slavery we are most familiar with – that of the antebellum South – is a historical aberration and probably economically inefficient. In most past forms of slavery – especially those of the ancient world – it was common for slaves to be paid wages, treated well, and often given their freedom. He argues that this was the result of rational economic calculation.


**What happens once robots substitute humans for most/all work.**
▪ In the earlier stages of the process, capitalism becomes more and more uncoupled from its previous job as an optimizer for human values. Now most humans are totally locked out of the group whose values capitalism optimizes for. They have no value to contribute as workers – and since in the absence of a spectacular social safety net it’s unclear how they would have much money – they have no value as customers either. Capitalism has passed them by. As the segment of humans who can be outcompeted by robots increases, capitalism passes by more and more people until eventually it locks out the human race entirely, once again in the vanishingly unlikely scenario that we are still around. (**Comment: Terrifying to think that all this beautiful society we have now may not be the result of careful, compassionate civilization design, but simply a result of incentives, and that if super powerful agents could get everything they want with AIs we could get to a dystopia fairly quickly**)


### Relief of System as An Agent
There’s [a passage](http://principiadiscordia.com/book/45.php) in the _Principia Discordia_ where Malaclypse complains to the Goddess about the evils of human society. “Everyone is hurting each other, the planet is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.” 

The **Goddess** answers: “What is the matter with that, if it’s what you want to do?”

**Malaclypse**: “But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!”

Goddess : “ Oh . Well , then stop.”
The implicit question is – **if everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it?** And Ginsberg answers : “Moloch” . It’s powerful not because it’s correct – nobody literally thinks an ancient Carthaginian demon causes everything – but because thinking of the system as an agent throws into relief the degree to which the system _isn’t_ an agent.

### We Live in a Dream Time
▪ It’s as if a group of those rats who had abandoned art and turned to cannibalism suddenly was blown away to a new empty island with a much higher carrying capacity, where they would once again have the breathing room to live in peace and create artistic master pieces. This is an age of whalefall, an age of excess carrying capacity, an age when we suddenly find our selves with a thousandmile head star t on Malthus. As Hanson puts it, this is the dream time. As long as resources aren’t scarce enough to lock us in a war of all against all, we can do silly non-optimal things – like art and music and philosophy and love – and not be outcompeted by merciless killing machines most of the time.

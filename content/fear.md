## What is Fear?
Danger and Fear are not the same. Danger is real, **Fear is the anticipation of danger our symbolic minds project everywhere**. 

After some point Fear becomes a mental [[habits]]
Many fears comes from a lack of [[Self Love]] and from aversion

- **Fear is not the same as concern**
    - The latter has a sense of stability

Fear and [[attachment]]
> Attachment creates a dependency, and dependency, because of its nature, intrinsically carries with it a fear of loss. 
> From [[Book - Letting Go - David Hawkins]]

## What Fear Does
- Fear doesn't only affect us, it affects reality as we experience it ([[everything is interconnected -interbeing-]])
	- The thing we're afraid of looks more scary when we're afraid

### Fear likes to wear masks
- it shows up in forms like [[stress]] and [[anxiety]]
	- stress is the fear of failing to live up to expectations?
	- anxiety is a state of constant fearful anticipation.  
	- The harsher your [[Inner Critic]] punishes you for not meeting expectations, the more stress and anxiety you will feel.
- Sometimes, the fear of acting towards your goal may **masks itself as non-attachment to a goal** ([[Detachment makes you perform better]])
	- It manages to prevent you from acting
	- You don't even realize you're not acting out of fear

### Physical Reactions
- sparks cortisol levels
- Immune system dysfunction
- Endocrine system dysfunction

## Practices

	- **Consistently confront fear to calibrate your fear GPS.** 
- [[mentally rehearse fears -negative visualization-]]
- [[Embrace Uncertainty]]
- [[choose faith over fear]]

- Craving and attachment make us fearful of not having whatever we crave and less likely to get it
	- [[Detachment makes you perform better]]

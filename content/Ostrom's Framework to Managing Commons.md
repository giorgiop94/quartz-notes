title: Ostrom's Framework to Managing Commons 
---
Framework developed by [[Elinor Ostrom]] to deal with the [[Tragedy of the Commons]]

Difficult to implement globally, but can be done locally and have a global impact

## 8 Core Design Principles

1. Shared Identity and Purpose
2. Equitable share of contribution and benefits
3. Fair and inclusive decision-making
4. Monitoring agreed behavior (transparency)
5. Gradual responding to moral and immoral behavior (start with gossip, then rewards and punishments, banishment)
6. Provide accessible, low-cost means for dispute resolution.
7. Authority to Self-Govern
8. Collaborative relations with other, similar groups (==fractal system of sub-groups==)

title: meditation increases agency

Back to: [[Meditation]] | [[Jamie Bristow]]

Agency intended as:

1. Perception/Attention
2. Understanding
3. Action

Similar to [[Jordan Greenhall]]'s concept of [[Sovereignty]]

## Perception/Attention
- Ability to pay attention to what's important
	- Especially today, technology and [[social media]], are continuously trying to hijack our attention, spreading misinformation. Meditation can help us develop a [[memetic immune system]] 

- Meditation is not just about attention and calm
	- it also involves openness, curiosity, kindness and care

- Stress and anxiety narrow our attention even more, making us more vulnerable to [[cognitive dissonance]]

- The information we take in is affected by [[Cognitive Bias]] but we are often unaware of it

## Understanding
- Improving our [[sense-making]] by helping us integrate our rational and intuitive intelligence
- See things from a broader perspective and through different ones
	- We become less identified with our thoughts/beliefs etc....

## Action
- Many of our actions are often reactive and conditioned by culture, not really stemming from conscious intentions
- Meditation helps us interrupt living on automatic pilot and living with more purpose
	- Building better habits

- The way meditation is currently taught is likely to be net-positive, but it could be a lot more powerful, if more integrated with things like ethics and compassionate action

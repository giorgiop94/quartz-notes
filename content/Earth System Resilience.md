The Earth has systems in place to remain in its current Holocenic state
through regulating [[Ecosystem Services]]

### Feedback Loops Keep The Earth Resilient
- [[balancing feedback loops]]
- [[Earth carbon storage]]
- White polar regions reflect sunlight helping to cool the Earth
	- If they melt they'd start absorbing heat reversing the feedback loop
- If you reduce vegetation → more CO2 is in the atmosphere → higher temperature → plants increase their biomass
	 - After some point, the ability of the Earth to maintain these feedback loops is disrupted

### Managing Earth Resilience
- The conventional approach in Environmental Management has been one of efficiency and optimization
	- This view only works if we know how the World works and if it works in linear ways
- When the impact show the characteristics below the conventional approach doesn't work
	- [[tipping points]]
	- unpredictability
	- [[Uncertainty]]
	- Uncontrollability 

### Tipping Elements
critical elements in maintaining the planet in favourable Holocene-like conditions.

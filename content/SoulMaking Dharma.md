title: SoulMaking Dharma 
---
Approach to [[Buddhism]] developed by [[Rob Burbea]] & [[Catherine McGee]]

**Unfabrication**
It starts from the recognition of the inherent [[Emptiness]] of all things (including emptiness itself).

**Skillful Fabrication**
This recognition gives permission and encourages a sort of Skillful Fabrication, that could have different "aims", such as meaningfulness, re-connecting to Eros, or strong emotions, new senses of beauty and much more.


## "What Soul Can Be Made from this?"
Catherine McGee, talking about the situation of the [[impending collapse of our systems]]

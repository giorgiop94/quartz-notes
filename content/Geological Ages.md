Cycles have been alternating between Ice ages and warmer periods

### Eemian (120,000 years back)
- Temperatures 2^C higher than Holocene
- Incredible sea level rise (4 to 6 meters higher)
### Last Ice age
- Really high temperature variability
- Humans almost went extinct
### Holocene (10,000 years)
- Stable period, great for human flourishing
- Great for rainforests and agriculture
	- Beginning of agriculture at the start of Holocene in four different locations
### Anthropocene 
- the period in which humans are the dominant force of geological change on Earth
- We're heading to 3C increase in temperature by the end of the century

#### What would make a good anthropocene?
- Fairness
	- No matter who your parents are, you'll have the same opportunities as everyone else
- Prosperity
- Sustainability

We need to research to see how we can integrate these three and how they can support one another

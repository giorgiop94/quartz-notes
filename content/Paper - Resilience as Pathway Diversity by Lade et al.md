## Aim 
Develop an approach to resilience that:
1. incorporates system elements ([[regime shifts]], feedbacks)
2. incorporates individual elements (agency, option, diversity)
3. is context-sensitive
4. is measurable

## Resilience as pathway diversity
Resilience = actors having more pathways available to them
Pathway = sequence of options or actions available to actors

Individual focus: options (choices)
System focus: consequences of choices on future options
Context sensitive: pathways to be assessed case by case

Measurable: count (of pathways); causal entropy (giving weightings to different pathways)

-**pathways diversity can be in opposition to stability-based resilience metrics**

### important considerations
- **IMPORTANCE TO TAKE A LONG-TERM HORIZON IN THIS METRIC**
- not geared for large systems (economy, ecosystem)
	- focused on one actor's strategyd

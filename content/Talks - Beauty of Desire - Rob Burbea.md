## Should We Let go of All Desire?
- Desire is infinite in its mystery
	- Can be explored by so many angles
	- We can't exhaust the exploration of desire
- Our idea of enlightened people is that of someone who has dropped all desire
	- Just perfectly happy with what is
- A common teaching is "Let go of all desire"
	- Is that even possible?
	- Subtle desires will probably remain
	- **Even the Buddha *desired* to share his teachings**

- We have to be careful that the path we are on doesn't shrink something within us that might be a blessing

### Do We Fear Desire?
- We often have a fear of deep desire	
	- Particularly desire of "deep" things, like God or enlightenment
	- Yet many other small desires go unnoticed and accepted. Desire for comfort, convenience etc...

### Connecting with Desire (Exercise)
Minute 14:00 - 40:00 of talk 1

- Imagining ourselves on our deathbed and asking ourselves (~ min 20-40?):
	- What did I want in my life
	- What do I regret not doing
- Asking "what do I want" may bring up a sense of lack
- The [[Inner Critic]] may come up and shut our desires down ("you can't never do that!")
	- That doesn't give the desire a chance to grow
	- Some of the reasoning of the IC may even be right
		- But if we're too quick to allow the IC to tell us why we won't be able to do something, we don't give desire a chance to grow 
- **==Maybe we need to protect desire like we protect a small plant that needs to grow==**
- **The inner critic inhibits desire and desire inhibits the inner critic**
	- 

### Another Side of Desire
- Have we proven it empirically that desire brings suffering?
- **Is it possible that a lack of desire or non-nourishing of desire also brings suffering?**
- **Is it possible that allowing desire creates depth, energy, dynamism and inner power into our heart or being?**

- > *"maybe conversely, not desiring, letting go of what I desire, maybe something in me gets disempowered, becomes weak (over time; I’m talking about years and longer), becomes flaccid or impotent, even, maybe, especially if I’m not desiring because there’s [[fear of desire]]"*
- Just following superficial desires also brings a weakening of the being

## Opening to Desire

- Fantasy of being a researcher into consciousness
	- How does that change your attitude to practice?
	- Instead of thinking of yourself "trying to do it right"?

### Practice
1. Dropping the assumptions that desire is problematic and to be suppressed
	- Playing with the assumption that desire might have something meaningful to give us
	- >"Ultimately one loves one’s desires and not that which is desired" [[Nietzche]]
2. Asking yourself "What am I wanting"?
	- Going deeper than the surface, mind craving (usually a specific object e.g. I want a gf)
		- I want to love, the opening of the heart, to see beauty in everything, the sense of being received
3. Sitting with and opening to the sense of desire
	- Being careful to a sense of lack emerging
		- Does lack necessarily need to be there when I feel desire? (hint: no)

title: form desire vs feeling desire 
---
- Form (material) desires constrain the way the future should look like based on a pre-conditioned form
	- There will always be a difference between our idealized desire and what actually manifests, leading to disappointment

- If we let go of feeling desires (joy, love etc..) we throw out the baby with the bathwater

**“If your life’s work can be accomplished in your lifetime, you’re not thinking big enough”** Wes Jackson


*a mindset inviting us to think in terms of multiple generations.*

An invitation to start building something, even though we know we'll never be able to see the completed result.

It wasn't unusual for cathedrals to take hundreds of years. In today's society, we've lost our ability to think long-term.

title: there is enlightenment and there's what you do with it 
---
Enlightenment can bring one to a nihilist perspective that nothing matters

### [[Ethics]]
- Enlightenment is not necessarily linked with ethical behavior
	- Example of Zen Buddhists condoning atrocious behavior during WW2

### Aspirations Matter
- Your aspirations create your understanding of the path and of enlightenment
	- Exploring your aspirations is an important part of the work
		- It could be the experience of non-dual awareness
		- It could be to be of benefit of all beings

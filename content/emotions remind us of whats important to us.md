title: emotions remind us of whats important to us 
---
> **We learn about _what’s important to us_ through our feelings. We learn about what we _value_.**

### Examples
> -   **Anger** tells us that something important to us is _blocked_
> -   **[[fear]],** that something important to us is _threatened_
> -   **Shame,** that we _haven’t been living up to_ something important to us
> -   **Confusion,** that we’re _missing a conception_ of something important to us
> -   and so on

### Feeling Through and Reconciling
[[Feeling Through Emotions]]

> feeling → appreciating → grappling → reconciling

Some feelings may point to opposing values, and that's when we're called to reconcile them

> Someone who’s felt through _all_ their situations has _integrity._ They’re _grounded_. Integrity means they know what’s important to them and they’ve grappled with all the conflicts.

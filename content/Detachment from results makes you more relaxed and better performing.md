- **Can we judge ourselves based on intentions rather than results?** [[Rob Burbea]]

The more you are focused on the outcome, the less you are focused on the here and now, on the action that allows you to achieve that outcome.

Being relaxed, rather than stressed, you are more likely to achieve what you want to.

> Learning how to turn down the perceived importance of something **while still choosing to participate** in its execution is a valuable skill to learn.

#### Archer Story By Chuang Tzu
>  When the archer shoots for no particular prize, he has all his skills; when he shoots to win a brass buckle, he is already nervous; when he shoots for a gold prize, he goes blind, sees two targets, and is out of his mind. His skill has not changed, but the prize divides him. He cares! He thinks more of winning than of shooting, and the need to win drains him of power.” Isn’t that an image of what most people are? When you’re living for nothing, you’ve got all your skills, you’ve got all your energy, you’re relaxed, you don’t care, it doesn’t matter whether you win or lose.
	From [[Book - Awareness - Anthony DeMello]]


From [[Tao Te Ching 2 - Nonduality]]

## Meditation Fantasies & The Soulmaking Dharma (Ep #3)

### Meditation Fantasies and Questioning Reality
[On Emerge Podcast # 3](https://castbox.fm/vb/90761812)

#### What is the point of practice?
- Up to each person to decide
- Many people don't fully articulate it to themselves

##### Fantasies in Meditation
- Medical Model (most common)
    - Meditating to heal
    - 4 Noble Truths â†’ Reducing suffering
    - Rest on many assumptions 
        - Primacy of brain functioning (materialist view of the world)
        - What reality is, what the world is
- Sense of Sacredness or Beauty (Artistic)
    - Seeing the practice as Art and doing it for its own sake
- Research Approach
    - Practicing to discover things about oneself or consciousness
- They can all co-exist at the same time in different proportion
- None of them is wrong
    - They can become constricting if taken too seriously
    - They are fantasies after all

- **The power of concepts, teachings and frameworks**
    - If no one ever introduced you to the possibility of sacredness, you may never experience it as it may not be in your framework
- **Medical model can become neutering or stagnant after some time**
	- Once suffering has been reduced the being wants other things
	- Erotic is often left out
		- Some people feel neutered by spiritual practice

#### Questioning Reality
- Reality seen as unquestionable (almost as a prison)
    - We have to learn to be ok with "what is"
- **Meditation can be a training to help us question the nature of reality**
    - Open the range of what we can perceive
- Different "[[ways of looking]]"
